            <p class="MPCtitle">Nursery-reception, 4-5 years<a name="5a" id="5a"></a></p>
            <p class="MPCtext">Whatever 
              the methods or media used, the training and experience which the 
              pupil brings to the task will be a major factor in success. For 
              example, in athletics a new style or technique is likely to make 
              a marginal improvement possible, but the athlete&#8217;s enthusiasm 
              and fitness, and the trainer&#8217;s skill are also very important. 
              The most important aspect of early teaching is concerned with the 
              &#8216;fitness of the athlete&#8217;. The skills of using spoken 
              language freely and well, being able to see and hear differences 
              and similarities, and getting interested in wanting to read are 
              the most important things to attend to initially. There is no need 
              to repeat the information and help available in a number of other 
              books and courses, but it is important to attend to this aspect 
              as well as to choose materials which suit your purposes.<br>
              <br>
              Today, great stress is laid on the importance of early language 
              skills in preparation for reading, as well as on all-round development. 
              Of course they are important, and as much as possible should be 
              done to teach them. However, it is possible that children whose 
              language background is poor are at an increased disadvantage if 
              they are expected to rely almost entirely on context cues in reading. 
              One way to tackle this problem is to increase the learner&#8217;s 
              language skill, but another approach is to make better use of other 
              clues to words, so that reasoning may come into play more fully. 
              Activities to train visual skills will possibly help children with 
              poor visual discrimination and memory, but they are likely to make 
              more progress using other skills as well, such as hearing and even 
              touch and movement. All the senses should be given stimulus and 
              practice in the pre-school child, for a multi-sensory approach gives 
              a far better chance of success.<br>
              <br>
              Sound discrimination activities are vitally important if an aid 
              like MPC is going to be used, though they would also benefit children 
              using other learning methods. Picture-sorting, a common visual activity, 
              is more useful if children are helped to sort by the first letter 
              sound, even before they know the symbol. &#8216;I-spy&#8217; games, 
              grouping things in scrapbooks according to first letter sound or 
              even vowel sound, calling out groups of children whose names begin 
              with the same sound, using music, rhythm and rhyme, all help to 
              train the ear. Children with mild speech defects may be helped by 
              such activities and should, of course, also receive whatever special 
              help is available. Any child who can speak must be able to hear 
              sound in order to reproduce it&#8217; he doesn&#8217;t ask for meat 
              when he wants a sweet, though he may say &#8216;sleet&#8217; or 
              something near it. What has first been done unconsciously and intuitively 
              needs to become more conscious in preparation for using written 
              symbols for these sounds. Children are often unaware of separate 
              words and may think of phrases like &#8216;got-to-go&#8217; or &#8216;in-a-minute&#8217; 
              as one unit. To read and write they must break up the flow of speech. 
              Activities with labels and wall-stories, suggested in <a href="arasa_2.htm#2">Chapter 
              2</a>, are valuable ways of showing children word relationships, 
              even before they may be expected to remember the details. Younger 
              children in the 5- to 7-year-old range can learn from watching older 
              ones matching words and letters, and start doing it themselves when 
              they are ready.

            <p class="MPCtitle">Infant classes, 5-7 years<a name="5b" id="5b"></a></p>
            
            <p class="MPCtext">Although 
              MPC is a system which concentrates on individual sounds, fifty to 
              a hundred words should be learnt as wholes before analysis by sounds 
              is introduced. During this period children should be learning to 
              write and recognise individual sounds, but only in readiness for 
              later word-building. This age-range should start with sight-recognition 
              of words and phrases. Word-attack skills should be introduced when 
              they already have a basic sight vocabulary, since using individual 
              sounds form the first might lead to the habit of stopping to build 
              up each word more than should be necessary. An approach using the 
              children&#8217;s own language should employ the same principle.<br>
              <br>
              Since phonic work of one kind or another will inevitably be undertaken 
              later, whether formally or informally, the sound-symbol bonds must 
              be thoroughly learnt. What better time to learn these than while 
              the letter-forms are being taught? The MPC Reading Workbook is designed 
              to do this, and provides individual practice to consolidate learning. 
              Informal ways of reaching the concepts of what sounds do in words 
              and sentences, what they are and how they can be used, are as vital, 
              at first, as learning number concepts before the use of their written 
              forms. Young children enjoy repetition, which is the natural way 
              a baby learns to practise vocal sounds. The same practice can be 
              given, for a few minutes each day, using a means such as the cue-card. 
              It will be well repaid later in an increased facility and freedom 
              to decode new words. Some teachers think there is no place at all 
              for repeating something until it is thoroughly memorised. If all 
              teaching were of this kind they would have a case, but it is a mistake 
              to ignore repetition altogether. Once the MPC sounds are fairly 
              well known children should have some means of using them to help 
              when they come to a new word in their reading, for instance in one 
              of the ways suggested in <a href="arasa_2.htm#2">Chapter 2</a>. 
              The cues will also be used for looking up words in small, marked 
              dictionaries or the <a href="resources.htm"> <em>MPC Word List</em></a> 
              to help with writing.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">
              Once an average seven-year-old level of reading has been reached 
              it may be time to use cues for spelling rules and word study, rather 
              than for reading, as explained in <a href="arasa_4.htm#4">Chapter 
              4</a>. All the other skills of reading &#8211; understanding the 
              main point of a story, using the context &#8211; and, of course, 
              writing all the attention, since enlarged experience in environmental 
              work, stories read aloud, art expression, music and so on, all help 
              the child to gain a balance of experience and enlarged vocabulary, 
              as well as being valuable and interesting in their own right. It 
              is vital that decoding ability should not be allowed to outstrip 
              vocabulary and experience. Meanings of new words become very important, 
              leading to the use of dictionaries. The child may, through learning 
              to read quickly, begin all the sooner to &#8216;read to learn&#8217;. 
              However, he should not attempt reading matter beyond his understanding 
              even if he can decipher the words. There is a wide choice of fiction 
              and information for this age level, and it is a good time to consolidate 
              and enjoy the fruits of learning to read, while concentrating on 
              mastering writing and spelling to some level of accuracy.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">For any children with such problems that they have not been able 
              to reach an average standard, a thorough recognition of phonic sounds 
              and their symbols will be invaluable in any remedial work. It is 
              frightening to find such children, after two or three years in school, 
              having learnt only a few words by sight recognition and very few 
              sounds. Surely they could learn forty-five sound-symbol bonds if 
              enough time were given to it. They could then make rapid reading 
              progress using MPC. Numerous experiments have shown that learning 
              the sounds and their symbols is the only real barrier to progress. 
              Once this has been done, the rest is easy.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">In teaching the two MPC symbols, the cross and the substitution, 
              it is important to present them not as yet another thing to learn, 
              but while explaining the structure of a word. For instance, if a 
              child comes to the word &#8216;beautiful&#8217; the teacher would 
              say something like this, putting in marks at the same time: &#8220;We 
              don&#8217;t sound the &#8216;e&#8217; or the &#8216;a&#8217; (putting 
              the cross over them) and the &#8216;u&#8217; (adding the bar) sounds 
              its name. Now can you put this part together? There are only two 
              sounds &#8216;<img src="images/words/bu.png" width="18" height="14">&#8217;. 
              Can you get it? Try the rest of the word. (Substitute &#8216;<img src="images/words/oo-slur.png" width="19" height="15">' 
              above the second &#8216;u&#8217;.) Now start the sentence again.&#8221; 
              The child will then probably be able to read the word. If not, another 
              approach would be to get him to leave out the word and find what 
              is being described, then go back to &#8216;beautiful&#8217; and 
              use a mixture of context nad phonic cues to find out what it is.
              </p>
              <p class="MPCtext">Children quickly understand how MPC can help, and find its logic 
              attractive. It is very hard on them, after being encouraged to use 
              reason in thinking things out and solving problems, to be presented 
              with some thing as illogical as the English spelling system. The 
              fact that MPC gives a guide that can be trusted in <em>every</em> 
              case is really appreciated and a great morale-booster.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">It is vital that word-building in this way should be encouraged 
              only once it really is helpful, so that it does not become a burden, 
              hindering the understanding of what is written. In the early stages 
              practice with sounds can be done in an enjoyable activity or game 
              (<a href="arasa_6.htm#A1">see Appendix 1</a>), separate from other 
              reading, until the required maturity is reached.</p>
               <hr>
            <p class="MPCtext"><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>
            <br>
            <p class="MPCtitle">Junior children, 7-11 years<a name="5c" id="5c"></a></p>
            <p class="MPCtext">For many 
              children there is a change of school at 7-plus. Ideally, close contact 
              between schools would prevent any problems connected with the change 
              from arising. If MPC was used in an Infant department the children 
              concerned should be allowed to continue with it and stop using it 
              when they are ready, at least with their reading. The best results 
              are achieved when a child has learnt the spelling rules using MPC, 
              so that it can be used for an understanding of word structure and 
              spelling, giving time for this to be internalised and the prop discarded. 
              Children who are moved from a school using MPC to a Junior school 
              which does not use it are at no disadvantage. Any learning of sounds 
              is equally valid in MPC and t.o., the children will not be used 
              to writing in a different script, and they will not have to change 
              their print in reading.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">
              On the other hand, if a Junior teacher who likes MPC has children 
              from an Infant school which did not use it, there will be no difficultly 
              in introducing it where needed. The children should already know 
              most of the phonic sounds, which are the basis of MPC, and some 
              revision of these with the introduction of the two marks, the cross 
              and the substitution, will allow its use. MPC shows sound-spelling 
              relationships clearly and so might at least be used when explaining 
              something involving this from the blackboard, or compiling lists 
              of different ways of spelling the same sound. Unfortunately, MPC 
              is of no help in deciding whether to use &#8216;their&#8217; or 
              &#8216;there&#8217;, &#8216;-tion&#8217; or &#8216;-sion&#8217;, 
              &#8216;-ight&#8217; or &#8216;-ite&#8217; in writing, although it 
              is a great help in rading such sounds with the right pronunciation. 
              A very interesting and imaginative form of word study can, however, 
              be undertaken using the <em>MPC Spelling Workbook</em> as explained 
              in <a href="arasa_4.htm#4">Chapter 4</a>. The extent to which this 
              would be advisable depends on the children and their skills.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">An analogy can be made between learning the skills of literacy and 
              finding your way in a new town. If you have a good aural memory, 
              instructions of the &#8216;first left, second right&#8217; variety 
              can be used. This is hopeless for those who can&#8217;t remember 
              what is said, but they may manage if the same instructions are written 
              down. Others, with good pictorial memory and understanding, may 
              do better looking at a street map. Some may use cues, like a pub 
              on the corner or an uphill slope or a shop. Even better, some may 
              learn by being accompanied a few times. However the process began, 
              after a time one just knows the way, forgetting how this knowledge 
              was acquired. Similarly it is in the early stages of teaching reading 
              that method is important. After a time the skill comes naturally. 
              In most cases different ways of teaching achieve very similar results 
              in the end. The main difference will be found in the less-able learners, 
              more of whom are likely to fall by the wayside if the method doesn&#8217;t 
              suit them or if they have been discouraged.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext"> An experiment comparing scores in pre-reading activities with progress 
              after nine months at school showed that children could make reasonable 
              progress if they were strong in some areas, such as language structure, 
              visual discrimination or sound discrimination, even if they were 
              weak in one of the other areas. Those who were far behind were weak 
              in almost all areas. It is unlikely that MPC can do much for these 
              children. They need to improve their powers of learning by practising 
              the kind of activities they should have done before starting school. 
              However, because MPC can use interesting material which is not graded 
              in too restrictive language, whole-word learning, use of context, 
              sounds and reasoning in almost equal quantities, the chances of 
              success are increased.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext"><br>
              One warning should be given about MPC. It is usually hard to interest 
              children in conventional word analysis of the kind used in Tansley&#8217;s 
              Sound Sense. On the other hand, a teacher who recently used MPC 
              for word analysis says the children find it so enjoyable that they 
              are inclined to do too much! This is perhaps the only drawback to 
              the scheme.</p>

            <p class="MPCtitle">Junior children with reading difficulties<a name="5d" id="5d"></a></p>
            <p class="MPCtext">The various 
              terms &#8216;remedial&#8217;, &#8216;slow-learning&#8217; and &#8216;backward&#8217; 
              really only describe some of the different kinds of difficulties. 
              Since this book does not purport to deal with all the related problems 
              of diagnosis and treatment it will pass over many points which are 
              vital to teachers, hoping that, if they feel their knowledge is 
              deficient here, they will attend a course or read some of the many 
              books on the subject.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">
              Some Juniors with below-average attainments are only just seven 
              on transfer and have not had as long in the Infant school as others. 
              This is sometimes overlooked in assessing them. A few of these will 
              also have had considerable periods of absence or have moved school 
              several times. They need to receive extra attention in following 
              the usual programme so that any gaps in their skills and knowledge 
              may be filled, e.g. by teaching phonic sounds. Some may be slightly 
              brain-damaged and deficient in ability in one or more areas, often 
              particularly in hand-eye co-ordination or perception. For these, 
              I would recommend training the weak points and using the strong 
              ones. Some have major or minor physical defects which are not always 
              diagnosed. For instance, if a child has one weak eye he may be able 
              to see and yet soon get tired of making the effort. Catarrh often 
              causes temporary deafness or partial loss of hearing. Examples of 
              cultural deprivation may range from the child who is well cared-for 
              physically and emotionally, but whose language is limited and interest 
              in books small, to one from a shocking home, who is maladjusted, 
              insecure, antisocial, lacking in proper sleep, and so on. In a few 
              cases children have been poorly taught, often because a system was 
              adhered to which didn&#8217;t suit the particular child, or because 
              there was not enough systems. These children may have widely differing 
              needs, different capacities and potential, different strengths and 
              weaknesses. No one idea will work for all of them. The teacher must 
              decide whether MPC is worth trying, either with a group or an individual, 
              and attention must be paid to many aspects other than the methods 
              used to teach reading.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">
              For one reason or another these children will have a small sight 
              vocabulary and lack skill in decoding new words. A good deal of 
              remedial work is therefore concerned with developing decoding skills, 
              learning sounds and blends, and trying to use them to attack new 
              words. It is necessary to find books which practise these skills, 
              as well as books which are of Junior interest, but of Infant reading 
              standard. Although there are now many of these on the market, they 
              are inclined either to concentrate on interest, like the <em>Griffin 
              and Pirate series</em> (E. J. Arnold), or on phonics, like the <em>Royal 
              Road Readers</em> (Chatto &amp; Windus). The <em>Oxford Colour Readers</em> 
              (O.U.P.) concentrate on picture cues while the <em>Dr Seuss</em> 
              books (Collins) combine comic-strip type humour for phonics with 
              humorous picture cues. Variety is important, so that the reading 
              material suits the child&#8217;s own needs and interests. This can 
              be ensued if the children make their own books by dictating them 
              or drawing the pictures for them.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">
              Of course, MPC can be added to any book, kit, reading-card or homemade 
              written matter. Any of the ideas described previously to avoid marking 
              the books could be used, and any method of learning sounds. For 
              children who take a long time to memorise anything, learning and 
              using the forty-five MPC sounds is much simpler either than trying 
              to remember many &#8216;sight&#8217; words or using standard phonics, 
              learning a large number of blends and groupings before the system 
              &#8216;works&#8217;. Moreover, the teacher has a much wider choice 
              of materials with which to try to arouse interest.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">
              If the class normally uses work-cards, harder words on them can 
              quickly be marked with MPC so that the poorer readers can decode 
              them without feeling inferior. The slow child is often ashamed of 
              his poor ability and does not ask for help when needed. MPC enables 
              him to progress alone, giving him an independence highly valued 
              by most children. They also like having their own small cue-cards 
              as memory-aids. If slow children in a normal class can help themselves, 
              more time will be spent in reading, and their attitudes towards 
              learning will be improved.</p>

            <p class="MPCtitle">Secondary children needing help<a name="5e" id="5e"></a></p>
            
            <p class="MPCtext">These 
              children usually understand and remember sounds and cues very quickly. 
              MPC can then be used on material suitable for their needs and interests. 
              This might include reading matter from newspapers or magazines, 
              forms, labels, signs and all the &#8216;real-life&#8217; written 
              material they so badly need to read. It should be remembered that 
              small print is difficult to cue. One way round this problem is to 
              print enlargements and simplified texts to go with magazine pictures 
              or sports news, mark them with MPC and paste them in. It is less 
              damaging to the self-respect of a backward child of secondary age 
              to be seen with an adult paper, even if he is reading something 
              pasted into it instead of the printed text, than to have an obviously 
              babyish book to read. If short, simple sentences and words mainly 
              of one or two syllables are used, material is less likely to be 
              too difficult, and it can still be varied and mature in content. 
              Cued books are especially useful here, enabling more varied reading 
              to take place.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">
              In some secondary schools all pupils are given the same topic worksheets 
              or assignments, the remedial teachers preparing simplified versions 
              for those who need them. If the slower children know MPC the cues 
              can be added to the worksheets instead of rewriting the whole assignment. 
              A secondary teacher who tried MPC with her less-able children reported 
              that they learnt it &#8216;almost at once&#8217; and that it worked 
              &#8216;like magic&#8217;.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">
              When children are being taught by a variety of teachers in a number 
              of different curriculum areas it has to be recognised that reading 
              progress in each subject is the responsibility of all teachers. 
              It cannot be confined to one or two special teachers. Even English 
              language teachers have to teach the appreciation of literature and 
              improved style in written work with the majority, and so find it 
              hard to help a few with basic skills at the same time. As with Juniors, 
              MPC allows more working without help once marks have been added 
              to the words likely to cause trouble. Books printed with cues would 
              probably be most useful with older children, because they would 
              benefit from longer passages and a greater variety of vocabulary 
              which it would be time-consuming to mark by hand. Some bright children 
              might be able to add cues accurately, thus aiding their own spelling 
              and analysis of word structure. These books could be used for slower 
              ones. Since larger print than usual may be needed for cues to be 
              clear, marked bookmarks or a marked dictionary of harder words at 
              the back of a book might be more practical. A tape of the cue-card 
              which could be borrowed and run through by a child who was well-motivated 
              to learn would make progress possible and require very little extra 
              teacher time. A teacher who tried MPC with some severely retarded 
              readers of 12-13 told me that it took only few minutes to explain 
              the system. If a child was stuck with a word, pencilling cues over 
              it enabled him to read it immediately. A cued dictionary, such as 
              the MPC Word List, would have enabled him to look a word up and 
              then read it. The small amount of initial instruction needed to 
              teach MPC and so enable backward secondary children to learn for 
              themselves is a clear advantage.</p>

            <p class="MPCtitle">Adult illiterates<a name="5f" id="5f"></a></p>
            <p class="MPCtext">Although 
              this title is commonly used, my own experience of two years evening-class 
              teaching of basic literacy has shown me what a variety of needs 
              it can cover. I originally took on the work intending to experiment 
              with the use of MPC with these students. Although I used some aspect 
              of it with most of them, either for reading or spelling, it was 
              a spectacular success with only a small proportion. I had to abandon 
              any idea of carrying out a set programme of learning sounds and 
              cues together and then using them with all pupils, because it was 
              obviously not in their best interests.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">
              Of weaker ones, with a reading age of 6-7 years, the majority knew 
              the alphabet letter-names and seemed to think learning phonic sounds 
              was babyish in some way. As they were so insecure and likely to 
              stop coming at the slightest setback I could not tell them that 
              the letter-names were practically useless and they should learn 
              something else. I therefore tried another tactic of getting them 
              to deduce sound from the letter-names, which some seemed able to 
              do, and continued telling them whole words and trying to increase 
              sight vocabulary. MPC, introduced as a spelling activity, was not 
              viewed as so childish. One very successful idea was to tape a radio 
              programme likely to interest most of them, such as a report on food 
              prices or a sports commentary, play it to them and at the same time 
              write up words that occurred in it on a board. We then used it for 
              discussion to help them talk and think about it. Next I would see 
              if they could read the words I had put up. Usually one or two knew 
              each word, so I used cues to point out the sounds and how letters 
              formed the phonic sound of the word, with some of them unsounded 
              with digraphs, etc. this worked very well and those who could not 
              read the words at first soon learnt to do so after a few tries.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">
              In this case, a number of students were West Indians, who had been 
              taught at school by learning letter-names first. This would be less 
              likely to occur with those who had attended British schools. However, 
              I found that some of these pupils had not &#8216;missed out&#8217; 
              on education in the popular sense, but were brain-damaged or handicapped 
              in various ways. Some had been to E.S.N schools where they had been 
              well taught to have achieved what they had done so far, and also 
              given the desire to learn more. These usually know most of the phonic 
              sounds and only needed some revision of digraphs to begin using 
              MPC providing they had the necessary reasoning power. On the other 
              hand, a small proportion were intelligent people who had long spells 
              in hospital as children, where either no teaching was given or they 
              were too ill to take it. Several had taught themselves to read but 
              were worried about their spelling. Some had never learnt the alphabet 
              order so that they could use a dictionary, and really only needed 
              that in order to help themselves. MPC may thus certainly be useful 
              with adults, but must be applied with discretion according to need. </p>
              <p class="MPCtext">
              The best approach with very poor adult readers is to aim at the 
              recognition of the hundred most common sight-words, while at the 
              same time working on word-attack skills with the <em>MPC Spelling 
              Workbook</em>. A reading scheme using MPC might well be useful in 
              some cases, using adult material. It would have the great advantages 
              of providing phonic practice on normal adult vocabulary, and giving 
              practice in seeing the relationship of sound and spelling in the 
              course of reading interesting material in context. Once sounds are 
              learnt, any marked books can be used.</p>
             <p class="MPCtext">
              I tried making reading cards on which a piece from a newspaper was 
              pasted and printed out in large type below, with cues added. Pupils 
              could take a card home and practise on the cued script, then try 
              reading the cutting on its own. Another idea, explained in <a href="arasa_3.htm#3">Chapter 
              3</a>, was to help a pupil to make his own book about his job or 
              family, or about cars or some other interest. Word matching and 
              word analysis using cues was practised on each bit as it was written. 
              Wall labels and comic strip pictures with captions were also used 
              with the virtual non-readers in the way advocated with Infants, 
              but made more relevant to their interests. Whereas schoolchildren 
              are a captive audience, it is important to keep adults coming happily, 
              and other considerations must sometimes be sacrificed to this one. 
              They thought a great deal of these books they had made themselves, 
              in some cases never having expressed themselves in writing before. 
              One man who started a little story about his childhood kept reading 
              a few lines over and over to himself with a sort of creative pride 
              which was quite touching. A woman who had not been able to write 
              to her son abroad wept over the first letter she managed to get 
              down on paper with a good deal of help. Another pupil, who had learnt 
              to read in English in school in Pakistan, could read even irregular 
              words like &#8216;neighbour&#8217; without difficulty, yet hardly 
              understood any word meanings. If anyone ever &#8216;barked at print&#8217; 
              he did. Speaking and extending his English vocabulary were his first 
              needs. He learnt very quickly, using children&#8217;s picture dictionaries 
              at first, and was soon persuaded not to be satisfied with reading 
              unless he understood it.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">
              Since this is not a book on teaching adults these matters are only 
              touched on to show how important it is to be sensitive to the needs 
              of one&#8217;s pupils. Although I think a knowledge of MPC may well 
              add to the tutor&#8217;s range of skills and resources, it must 
              only be used where useful and not be expected to meet all needs. 
              The older the pupil, the wider the variety becomes. When teaching 
              adults on a one-to-one basis, simply pencilling MPC over words on 
              which people get stuck is very useful. It helps the pupil to see 
              the sound-spelling correspondence and is a reminder if he reads 
              it again to himself.</p>

            <p class="MPCtitle"> Overseas students learning to read English<a name="5g" id="5g"></a></p>
            
            <p class="MPCtext">This 
              category also covers a wide range of needs. At present I can only 
              suggest in what ways MPC might prove useful.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">It is likely that it would be a very good method for intelligent 
              English speakers who have never before learnt to read or write the 
              language. They would learn the sounds and cues very quickly and 
              then, if given cued reading books, could teach themselves a great 
              deal and learn with very little help. This would be a great advantage 
              where resources were limited and very formal teaching methods necessary. 
              A short spell of direct formal teaching would quickly be followed 
              by independent reading. Another great advantage is that the basic 
              sounds could be taught with an English accent and then applied to 
              words. The <em>MPC Spelling Workbook</em> would be very useful in 
              doing this. The main problem would probably be that although such 
              pupils speak English it is really their second language and that 
              therefore their reading technique might soon outstrip their vocabulary. 
              However, if less time were needed for learning the mechanics of 
              reading more time could be given to extending experience and vocabulary 
              in various ways.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">
              English has an advantage over some languages in having such things 
              as invariable adjectives and relatively simple declensions. However, 
              word meanings such as &#8216;go on, go off, go away, go to, go after, 
              go with&#8217; give trouble because they are so varied. Irregular 
              spelling is another source of difficulty. The use of MPC in such 
              cases would be very much a matter for the teacher&#8217;s discretion. 
              It would be quite permissible, for instance, to point out the number 
              of unsounded letters by using the cross over them when giving explanations, 
              or to use the bar and slur in the same way to show pronunciation 
              where needed, without using the full system. One or two teachers 
              who tried MPC stated that some of it seemed unnecessary with their 
              pupils but they had used some aspect of it where they found it useful. 
              This is fine and must be emphasised as one of the advantages of 
              the system. It can and should be used and adapted in any way required. 
              The teacher is the best judge of what her pupils need, and has no 
              need to feel guilty if using MPC in a different way from one that 
              has been advocated, provided it works. For instance, one person 
              who tried it said that the cue-card had several things on it which 
              the children didn&#8217;t understand, e.g. they didn&#8217;t know 
              what an acorn was. The obvious thing to do would be to alter this 
              picture to &#8216;ape&#8217; or &#8216;ace&#8217; or anything the 
              pupils did know. Similarly, objects have different names in different 
              places, e.g. a van may be called a truck; there may be no thistles 
              or roses or owls. So you alter it to something else. There is nothing 
              sacrosanct about the pictures which are used to aid sound recognition, 
              though the sounds themselves should remain largely the same, as 
              they have been carefully considered. Deviation from them might be 
              necessary if, for instance, teaching in a Scottish accent, where 
              &#8216;bot&#8217; and &#8216;foot&#8217; have the same vowel sound. 
              There may be no need then to use the two forms on the cue-card. 
              Some may feel that the sound &#8216;ear&#8217; should be included 
              on the cue-card, and should therefore add it.</p>

            <p class="MPCtext">It is 
              becoming increasingly common to include the study of language structure 
              in various courses on language and communication. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">International 
              Phonetic Alphabet </a>is a rather complicated designation of the 
              English sound system. Some symbols, being unlike English forms, 
              need some practice in learning and can easily be misinterpreted 
              when used for just one or two lectures. MPC provides a simple and 
              reliable alternative which is readily understood by the non-specialist.<br>
