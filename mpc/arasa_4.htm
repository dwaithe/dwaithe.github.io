            <p class="MPCtext">Minimal 
              phonic cues are intended only as a temporary aid to learning. It 
              is therefore necessary to consider how long they should be used 
              and in what way they should be discarded. Because there is no changeover 
              to another script, the way in which the cues are discarded depends 
              largely on the way in which they have been used.<br>

            <p class="MPCtitle">An MPC reading programme<a name="4a" id="4a"></a></p>
            <p class="MPCtext">This 
              example is based on work which was tried in an Infant class of about 
              thirty-five children with a range of five to seven years. Though 
              set out in the form of a progression, individual children were at 
              different points on the programme. Books were not marked but new 
              words were on cued lists.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">1. Pre-reading 
              work to develop language, visual and aural discrimination, interest 
              in stories, understanding the use of labels to convey meaning, etc.<br>
              2. Using means such as wall-stories, captions on the children&#8217;s 
              own pictures, class news books, the breakthrough stand and materials 
              (Long-man), to aid word matching and sentence matching and to give 
              the idea that print conveys meaning.<br>
              3. Writing begun, letter formation and learning of sounds.<br>
              4. Any other reading pursued intuitively by whole-word learning 
              until at least consonant sounds are known, when they should be used 
              as guide in conjunction with context clues. Phonic work as suggested 
              in <a href="arasa_3.htm#3">Chapter 3.</a><br>
              5. After the sound concepts are well established, repetition and 
              some drilling on sound symbols for about five minutes daily until, 
              with the cue-card as an aid to memory, MPC can be used for decoding 
              new words. Children given individual cue-cards to learn and use. 
              Large wall cue-card provided.<br>
              6. MPC then used in one or more of the ways suggested in <a href="arasa_2.htm#2">Chapter 
              2</a>.<br>
              7. If new words are marked on books, children can ignore any marks 
              they don&#8217;t need. Once a vocabulary of about 150 words is known, 
              (usually by about the fourth book of a reading scheme), work could 
              begin on extracting the rules of spelling and pronunciation using 
              some system of word analysis. MPC dictionaries could still be used, 
              but group teaching using MPC Spelling Workbook will now speed the 
              process of internalising the sound-symbol relationships before children 
              go on to a Junior class.<br>
              In age-grouped classes the programme should be begun and proceed 
              as far as possible, with records kept on children&#8217;s progress 
              so that it can be continued without interruption according to individual 
              needs. An ideal form for such records is shown in Figure 8, using 
              squared paper. The stages may be groups of sounds learnt, books 
              read or any graded set of skills. It is then easy to group children 
              for practice by lookng down the record to see which are at the same 
              stage.</p>

            <p class="MPCtext">To achieve 
              the maximum benefit this programme should be agreed and co-ordinated 
              throughout an Infant department. If some teachers wish to use MPC, 
              while others do not, it should be used only incidentally to aid 
              understanding and not be relied on too heavily. Partial use in this 
              way is not confusing because no departure has been made from normal 
              spelling. No harm will be done if MPC is incompletely mastered by 
              the time of transfer to another school, provided that analysis was 
              not over-emphasised at a stage when it was only confusing rather 
              than helpful to a child who could have made some progress by whole 
              word learning and use of context. Slow-learning children are greatly 
              helped in later &#8216;remedial&#8217; work (though this is a misnomer 
              for children properly taught) if they really know the sounds and 
              digraphs thoroughly, whether cues are to be used or not. If cues 
              are used in later teaching of slow-learners, a basic knowledge of 
              the sounds as shown on the cue-card will enable quick progress to 
              be made once the child has attained the mental maturity necessary 
              for satisfactory analysis and synthesis. Independent learning using 
              cues will then also be helped.<br>

            <p class="MPCtitle">Leaving cues behind<a name="4b" id="4b"></a></p>
            <p class="MPCtext">The transfer 
              consists of &#8216;internalising&#8217; the cues; knowing that an 
              &#8216;e&#8217; at the end of a word is not sounded, that &#8216;gh&#8217; 
              is similar, but may modify the preceding vowel, that &#8216;-tion&#8217; 
              is sounded &#8216;shon&#8217;, etc.; the things which good readers 
              do unconsciously without cues. Cues aid this normal process and, 
              having made it more conscious, also help spelling.<br>
              The <a href="resources.htm"><em>MPC spelling Workbook</em></a> defines 
              the main spelling rules, using cues, and suggests children&#8217;s 
              activities for each rule. In this way, learning is reinforced. The 
              book&#8217;s contents are briefly listed below. Of course, these 
              are all rules which have to be learnt whether MPC is used or not. 
              The progression is designed to ensure that children who have used 
              MPC in the early stages are finally able to discard it while getting 
              as much value as possible from it. Each page of the <a href="resources.htm"><em>MPC 
              Spelling Workbook</em></a> could serve as the source material for 
              a group lesson or discussion.</p>

              also play a part.</p>

              these sounds vary much more than consonants in the ways they are 
              spelt, partly because speech has changed over the years and in different 
              places.</p>

              course, use professional judgement as to how much of this children 
              can do at a time, and when. If giving too many alternatives only 
              seems to confuse it may be better left until later.</p>

              <em>c-a-t</em>, etc., the reader must be able to sound <em>c-a-f</em> 
              or <em>d-a-l</em>, because these are syllables within words. Attention 
              to syllable-reading is often neglected and is a cause of some difficulties. 
              Obviously, this work is done as needed, and not otherwise.</p>

              The various sounds and spellings of <em>&#8211;tion, -sion </em>and 
              <em>&#8211;cian</em>. These are mainly longer words and children 
              need to be advanced in their reading to cope with them.</p>

              Alphabetical order, needed for looking up words and for listing 
              things, is sometimes neglected. See that children can recite the 
              letters of the alphabet in order at some point, and also give practice 
              in thinking whether one letter comes before another, to help in 
              looking forward or back. Plenty of practice is needed in various 
              ways before children can use a dictionary quickly and, of course, 
              small wordbooks, followed by 500-word, 1000-word or 2000-word dictionaries 
              may help children to reach the stage of using a bigger one. The 
              <em><a href="resources.htm">MPC Word List</a></em> will be found 
              very useful here. Exercises on finding a word its second or third 
              letter are also needed, e.g. <em>because, before, behind</em>.</p>

              Check that all small letters and capital letters are known. For 
              bright and average children this should be so by the time they transfer 
              from Infant to Junior classes. Once children can read and write 
              with reasonable fluency it is better for them to use the letter-names 
              for spellings. For the less-able this should be postponed until 
              they can read without needing to build up sounds aloud, or they 
              will get confused. Eventually, both will be known. If MPC has been 
              used systematically, capital letters which differ from lower-case 
              will have been marked with substitutions.</p>
