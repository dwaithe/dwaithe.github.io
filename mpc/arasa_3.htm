              </strong></p>
            <p class="MPCtext">It should 
              now be apparent that a thorough learning of individual sounds and 
              symbols and the ability to blend are essential before MPC can be 
              properly and effectively used. It would be interesting to see whether 
              simply drilling the sounds, teaching how to blend and use cues and 
              then starting on cued reading material would work. After only a 
              short period of drilling there would be complete freedom to read 
              anything. However, this would be very unsophisticated and is not 
              advised. </p>

            <p><strong>Teaching the 
              basic phonic sounds<a name="3a" id="3a"></a><br>
              </strong></p>
            <p class="MPCtext">In Infant 
              classes the normal or current programme of early reading should 
              not be interfered with, but learning sounds and their symbols should 
              take place at the same time, perhaps as a separate activity. Children 
              should be shown how to form letters properly, not just left to copy 
              sentences written by the teacher. This is a good time to teach the 
              concepts represented by the symbols which they are learning to write&#8217; 
              to show that a<em> number</em> of words begin with &#8216;b&#8217; 
              and not just one on a chart, that although the second at the beginning 
              of a word is a good guide to it, the sound may also occur in the 
              middle or at the end of a word. Traditionally, children of three 
              and four have had alphabet books which taught them to say one letter 
              at a time while looking at a picture connected with it. If they 
              learnt the phonic sounds in this way it would certainly do no harm. 
              But other considerations must be remembered: interest, meaning, 
              concentration, left-right sequence, language development, and the 
              need to improve visual and aural discrimination and memory. Exercises 
              may help any skill, but it is far better if the skill can be combined 
              with other activities or learnt, at least in part, incidentally. 
              It is like comparing the old method of learning music by practising 
              scales first with modern methods. The scales may be a good thing 
              later, but could put the child off music altogether if done without 
              meaning. <br>
              <br>
              One way of teaching sounds with the maximum amount of meaning is 
              to write labels for the classroom which contain all the MPC sounds, 
              making matching sentences, matching words and also matching sounds 
              of the same size. There is thus meaning in every part. For example, 
              I made labels on which the following sentences were written with 
              cues:</p>
            <p><img src="images/words/Read%20quietly%20in%20this%20corner.png" width="243" height="214"></p>
            <p class="MPCtext"><br>
              In line with the theory that the two main aspects of literacy are 
              fact and fiction, a wall-story was the next idea which I treated 
              in this way. The children had heard and enjoyed <em>The Gingerbread 
              Boy</em> so a wall-story was made (rather a long one, as some children 
              were seven). A picture accompanied each sentence.</p>
            <p><img src="images/words/The%20farmer%27s%20wife%20was%20cooking.png" width="366" height="188"></p>
            <p class="MPCtext">This 
              was a popular piece of equipment. The children enjoyed reading it, 
              some more or less learning it by heart and then learning to pick 
              out the words. Once children also got the idea of finding sounds, 
              they became very interested in trying to match them and would often 
              do it on their own. With MPC every sound can be matched accurately, 
              and there is no confusion between &#8216;a&#8217;, &#8216;<img src="images/words/a.png" width="10" height="14" align="absmiddle">&#8217;, 
              &#8216;ah&#8217;, &#8216;au&#8217;, etc. Children can see for themselves 
              if there is a discrepancy between sound and spelling. Given suitable 
              stimulus and encouragement, much can be learnt from these matching 
              activities, each sound being in context both in a word and in a 
              meaningful sentence. <br>
              <br>
              Because they take some time to make, it is tempting to leave one 
              wall story up for too long. It is advisable to change the story 
              every week or so, since once the freshness has gone it can easily 
              be ignored and lose its value. We replaced <em>The Gingerbread Boy</em> 
              with <em>Jack and the Beanstalk</em>, treated in the same way, with 
              matching sentences, then words, then sounds. The sentences were:</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">
              1) Jack sold the poor cow.<br>
              2) He got some magic beans.<br>
              3) They grew into a great beanstalk.<br>
              4) Jack climbed up to the giant&#8217;s house.<br>
              5) Fee, fi, fo, fum, yelled the giant.<br>
              6) Quick! Hide! Said the giant&#8217;s wife.<br>
              7) Where is my goose? Fetch her.<br>
              8) She laid a very large egg.<br>
              9) Oi, mother. Bring me my axe.<br>
              10) Down fell the giant with a crash.<br>
              <br>
              This also contains all the forty-five MPC sounds. When working out 
              sentences of this kind a few sounds are difficult to fit in, usually 
              &#8216;x&#8217;, &#8216;j&#8217; &#8216;oi&#8217; and &#8216;qu&#8217;, 
              which are not so commonly used. A little alteration may be necessary 
              to include these. Here we change &#8216;Hi, mother&#8217;, to &#8216;Oi, 
              mother&#8217; because &#8216;oi&#8217; did not appear anywhere else. 
              It is better, though, to teach the less-used sounds in some other 
              way than by contriving unnatural sounding phrases.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">
              Even with quite a lot of matching practice most children still need 
              daily repetition for symbols to be thoroughly known. It is rather 
              like learning multiplication tables. All kinds of activities ensure 
              the concepts are understood, but there is still the need to repeat 
              and memorise later. Once the concepts of what sounds are, and what 
              they do, are known, the cue-card should be gone though daily, with 
              picture mnemonics, until the pictures can be discarded. Any other 
              means liked by the teacher, such as card games, <em>Breakthrough</em> 
              phonic folders (Longman) or Stott apparatus (Holmes-McDougall) can 
              easily be adapted for MPC.</p>
              The same wall-story technique could be used without MPC, but would 
              have to use matching letters, even if their sounds did not correspond, 
              or be confined to those that did correspond, perhaps just consonants. 
              This does not have the same value as MPC in pointing out the relationship 
              between sound and spelling in, for instance, the word &#8216;<img src="images/words/four.png" width="30" height="21" align="bottom">&#8217;, where the vowel sound is irregular.</p>
               <p class="MPCtext"> The way in which MPC includes the digraphs &#8216;ch&#8217;, &#8216;sh&#8217;, 
              etc. in the early learning is also an important advantage. They 
              are not more difficult to learn if taught as one sound, and not 
              knowing them is a source of trouble. In one school which I was comparing 
              with my experimental class I found only single sounds had been learnt, 
              and was told they &#8216;hadn&#8217;t come to the others yet&#8217;. 
              The linking of digraphs with a slur aids their assimilation as one 
              sound, but it is important that younger children should realise 
              that the slur is not part of the symbol. It should therefore be 
              drawn more faintly or in a different colour. Though colour makes 
              cues more attractive to the younger ones. It takes longer to do 
              and is not really necessary. There is no reason, however why a teacher 
              should not use different colours if she wants to do so in marking 
              apparatus or books for those starting to learn to read with MPC.</p>

            <p class="MPCtitle">Adaptations for older slow-learners<a name="3b" id="3b"></a></p>
            
            <p class="MPCtext">These examples of the 
              matching labels and wall-stories were made for older slow-learners 
              and adults, and also include all the sounds.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">1) A crow sat on a high 
              branch.<br>
              2) She had just found some cheese.<br>
              3) The fox looked up at her there.<br>
              4) Why are you so quiet? He said.<br>
              5) I am sure you can sing very well.<br>
              6) So the crow made a big noise.<br>
              7) The cheese fell out of her mouth.<br>
              8) The fox soon ate it and ran away.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">The next one was made 
              up for an adult class using a small, rather bare room.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">1) The window is made 
              of glass.<br>
              2) Our tables are wooden ones.<br>
              3) The walls are plastered now.<br>
              4) These are light metal chairs.<br>
              5) This is a square shape.<br>
              6) These tables have been joined together.<br>
              7) You can keep things in here.<br>
              8) We sit where we choose.<br>
              9) Cards go in this box.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">The labels 
              could be arranged in place at the start of a session. they may sound 
              dull, but their down-to-earth, everyday nature appealed to these 
              slow-learners as something that made sense. The labels could be 
              fixed with Blu-tack and removed to be put away again. This is one 
              way of coping when using a room once or twice a week, which is also 
              used by other classes.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">Comic strip stories can be adapted in the same way to provide the 
              interest of fiction. A sixteen-year-old slow reader, who showed 
              very little interest in the books available, frequently brought 
              in comics, whose lurid picture stories he followed avidly. I realised 
              that what he needed was action. With his help I produced the sentences 
              below, made out on cards for the <em>Language Master</em> (Bell 
              &amp; Howell) so that he could put them through and hear them in 
              order. Then I got him to match words and sounds, written on separate 
              cards, and put them in place on the sentence cards, using paperclips. 
              When he could do this, and had done other preliminary work, I gave 
              him a tape of the cue-card to which he could listen as he pointed 
              to each sound.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">This particular boy had previously managed to learn most of the 
              alphabet sounds, and capital (but not small) letters. If he had 
              been taught MPC from the start I have no doubt that he could have 
              read, using cues, in spite of his very limited memory.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">1) This man went shooting 
              tigers.<br>
              2) The tigers were very fierce.<br>
              3) They had gone far into the jungle.<br>
              4) The tigers were not frightened.<br>
              5) A tiger can kill a man.<br>
              6) Here is a big one coming now.<br>
              7) I&#8217;ll fix him, says the man.<br>
              8) He points his gun carefully.<br>
              9) Whizz! He has missed the tiger.<br>
              10) The tiger is chasing him now.<br>
              11) The man is climbing a tree.<br>
              12) But tigers know how to climb trees.<br>
              13) He has nearly got his paw to the man.<br>
              14) The man uses his gun quickly.<br>
              15) This time the tiger falls down dead.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">It is 
              not easy to get excitement and a sense of urgency into such simple 
              writing, but it is worth the effort if it arouses interest. MPC 
              gives the great advantage of allowing phonics to be studied using 
              this kind of material, instead of &#8216;The dog sat on the log&#8217; 
              variety. To maintain interest, of course, a series of stories would 
              be needed, so that not too much time is spent on one story and its 
              analysis.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">The following strip story 
              is suitable for any age. This also includes all the MPC sounds.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">1) Meet the Smith family.<br>
              2) Mrs Smith is cooking the dinner.<br>
              3) Mr Smith is washing the car.<br>
              4) Jimmy is going to school.<br>
              5) Mary is playing in the garden.<br>
              6) Baby is crying in the pram.<br>
              7) The dog is asleep in his box.<br>
              8) Mrs Smith says, Dinner is ready now.<br>
              9) Mr Smith says, Quick! What have you got for us?<br>
              10) Jimmy says, I though we were having chops.<br>
              11) Mary says, I thought it was a joint of beef!<br>
              12) The baby is having some milk.<br>
              13) The dog has got a bone.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">Workcards were used to 
              aid analysis of this story, for example:</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">Find these silent letters 
              <strong>e n m h y a k o gh</strong><br>
              (They can be found in <em>were, dinner, Jimmy, school, playing, 
              ready, quick</em> and <em>thought</em>, as examples.)<br>
              Find these different sounds for letter <strong>a</strong>: o <img src="images/words/ah.png" width="18" height="17" align="bottom"> 
              <img src="images/words/air.png" width="19" height="16" align="baseline">(was, 
              car, Mary); <strong>o</strong> sounding u (some); <strong>o</strong> 
              sounding oo (cooking)<br>
              The marks make these easy to see and provide an interesting puzzle 
              element for children ready to do some analysis.<br>
              <a href="arasa_6.htm#A1">Appendix 1</a> contains further simple 
              games designed to give practice in memorising the sounds and early 
              sight vocabulary, so reinforcing learning.</p>

            <p class="MPCtitle">Starting MPC with children who know most of the phonic sounds<a name="3c" id="3c"></a></p>
            <p class="MPCtext">These 
              children should already know the short vowels and single consonants, 
              which are exactly the same in MPC and t.o.:<br>
              <strong>a e i o u</strong> as in <em>cat, get, tin, pot, cup</em><br>
              <strong>b c d f g h j k l m n p r s t v w x y z</strong> are all 
              exactly the same.<br>
              Consonant blends of digraphs may or may not be known, but should 
              be checked: <strong>qu, ng,</strong> <img src="images/words/th.png" width="14" height="17"> 
              (as in <em>they</em>), <img src="images/words/th_slur.png" width="14" height="18"> 
              (as in<em> think</em>), <strong>sh</strong>, <strong>wh</strong> 
              and <strong>ch</strong>. The vowel blends are <strong>ah, er, ow</strong>, 
              <img src="images/words/oo.png" width="19" height="14">(as in boot), 
              <img src="images/words/oo-slur.png" width="19" height="15"> (as 
              in<em> foot</em>, except in Scotland) and <img src="images/words/air.png" width="19" height="16">. 
              The bar is understood to show the letter-name, <img src="images/words/a.png" width="10" height="14">, 
              <img src="images/words/e.png" width="10" height="14">, <img src="images/words/i.png" width="9" height="17">, 
              <img src="images/words/o.png" width="10" height="14"> and <img src="images/words/u.png" width="9" height="14">. 
              If MPC is used it is not necessary to know any other alternative 
              sounds or blends, like &#8216;oy&#8217; or &#8216;aw&#8217;, &#8216;igh&#8217; 
              or &#8216;ai&#8217;. These will follow later, but could be learnt 
              by using substitutions over them at first. Thus, if you decided 
              to use MPC with slower Juniors and found they already knew the usual 
              simple phonic sounds, reference to the cue-card would probably be 
              all that was needed before they could begin decoding any marked 
              word for themselves. The cross indicating silent letters and the 
              substitution are quickly understood.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">Limitations to MPC&#8217;s use are found in some cases where a child&#8217;s 
              sight memory for words is so good that analysis seems unnecessary 
              and rules seem to be deduced automatically. There is then no need 
              to interfere with a natural reading ability. The use of MPC for 
              some spelling analysis might be useful in such cases, and would 
              probably be enjoyed and quickly understood to improve insight into 
              language. The other limitation is when children have such poor reasoning 
              power that analysis only makes things seem more impossible and does 
              not sustain their interest. MPC works extremely well with fairly 
              mature children who can reason but who do not memorise easily. Teaching 
              skills such as selection of the right time and place, how long to 
              stay on one thing and what will keep up interest as well as reinforce 
              what must be learnt, must be exercised with MPC as with any other 
              teaching aid.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">There are many useful aids for teaching phonics, such as those in 
              <em>Phonics</em> and the <em>Teaching of Reading</em> by J.M. Hughes 
              (Evans Brothers, 1972), and there is no need to repeat here what 
              is readily available elsewhere. However, the more complex forms, 
              such as &#8216;ea&#8217;, &#8216;final e&#8217;, &#8216;-tion&#8217;, 
              can be left till later, and reading using MPC can be done without 
              them. These rules and exceptions could then be deduced in the course 
              of reading in the same way. It is hoped, as rules of grammar are 
              absorbed in the course of learning to speak. It is probable that 
              better learning will take place if rules are pointed out and reinforced, 
              but this can be done once reading is already fluent using MPC (<a href="arasa_4.htm#4">see 
              Chapter 4</a>). </p>

            <p class="MPCtitle">Learning to blend sounds<a name="3d" id="3d"></a></p>
            
            <p class="MPCtext">The other 
              consideration is blending, which is a problem in MPC just as it 
              is in any other phonic work. It is quite common to meet children 
              who know the sounds and yet cannot put them together. Many writers 
              stress that to add a vowel to consonants, which is difficult to 
              avoid when trying to be heard across a classroom, creates unnecessary 
              difficulty. &#8216;Ber-a-ter&#8217; does not sound &#8216;bat&#8217; 
              and this should be remembered. One group with this fault was helped 
              by the verses shown below. These were put up on the wall in large 
              print and we read them through until they were known.</p>
            <p>My d-a-d dad<br>
              Is s-a-d sad<br>
              For the pain in his tooth is so b-a-d bad.</p>
            <p>Some m-e-n men<br>
              Kept a h-e-n hen<br>
              And when it had chicks<br>
              They had t-e-n ten.</p>
            <p>Young S-i-d Sid<br>
              Made a b-i-d bid<br>
              But he lost all his cash<br>
              So he h-i-d hid.</p>
            <p>Jimmy g-o-t got<br>
              Much too h-o-t hot<br>

            <p>Children should, of course, 
              learn style and appreciation of literature once they been taught 
              to read. This kind of idea is used as a step on the way and more 
              or less in desperation when confronted with children who are hard 
              to teach and difficult to interest.<br>

            <p class="MPCtitle">Learning sounds in context<a name="3e" id="3e"></a></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">One cannot 
              always know enough about the experiences of such children to judge 
              what has lead to this kind of problem, or whether better methods 
              would prevent it. However, it is likely that learning sounds within 
              words rather than in isolation, as suggested earlier, would help. 
              The method outlined here has proved very effective in achieving 
              this.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">The principle is to provide a simple, illustrated sentence within 
              the child&#8217;s interest and experience, which is read first. 
              Two letters are picked out below it. The teacher sounds these and 
              points out where they occur in the sentence. In order to emphasise 
              meaning the child is then asked a relevant question, which necessitates 
              making some prediction or association. Below this are a number of 
              random repetitions of the two symbols, from which the child has 
              to pick out the letters and discriminate between them, with help 
              if necessary. For example:</p>
            <p class="MPCtext"><strong>Figure 6</strong></p>
            <p><img src="images/figure/Fig_6.png" width="418" height="243"></p>
            <p class="MPCtext">In this 
              case the teacher might use the following approach: &#8220; Do you 
              know what those two letters say? What words are they under? Read 
              the sentence until you come to the first one. What word is it? What 
              does it begin with? That&#8217;s the sound &#8216;m&#8217;. What 
              word is that letter under? (dog) What sound does that start with? 
              (&#8216;d&#8217;) Now point to the &#8216;d&#8217; sounds underneath. 
              Point to a &#8216;m&#8217;, now a &#8216;d&#8217;.&#8221;<br>
              <br>
              Generally, the teacher should read the first sentence, or help the 
              child to do so, if he can, and then point out the sounds. After 
              this preliminary work the child can be left alone to complete some 
              follow-up activity, e.g. Colour these pictures and write the letters 
              under the pictures they belong to.</p>
            <p><strong>Figure 7</strong></p>
            <p><img src="images/figure/Fig_7.png" width="447" height="196"></p>
            <p class="MPCtext">The <em>MPC 
              Reading Workbook</em> is based on this idea and provides practice 
              in forming letters as well as in recognising them. Follow-up activities 
              designed to reinforce learning are also suggested. Different sentences 
              could of course be used according to the age and ability of the 
              children, while older slow-learners could use them for individual 
              work, with a tape.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">Blending can also be taught by pointing to sounds on a large cue-card 
              and moving about to make words, first of two letters, then of three, 
              e.g. <em>at, in, up; cat, win, pup</em>. Children may then try this 
              individually or in pairs and see how many words they can make, if 
              possible in sentences.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">Other 
              simple ideas to give variety and aid memory are jingles like this 
              which could be put on the wall and illustrated. These contain all 
              the MPC vowel sounds.</p>

            <p class="MPCtext">The use 
              of cues can be revised using flashcards based on your existing reading 
              scheme. Write the same word on both sides of a card, cueing one 
              side only. Help children to learn the words using cues, then to 
              try to remember them without cues. The cards can be held up for 
              work with a group, or given to pairs or individual children. Knowing 
              the first hundred most common words is a great help in making a 
              start, since these form a large proportion of all reading matter. 
              It is vital to go through them with the children and show them how 
              the cues are cued before they can be left to do it themselves. Words 
              with more than two syllables should not be used, since these require 
              a skill in breaking down words which should be taught later.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">
              Once this decoding ability has been acquired it is possible for 
              it to outstrip understanding. This makes it even more essential 
              that attention should be given to general language, knowledge and 
              experience of all kinds as well as to reading. The teacher should 
              encourage the use of dictionaries in which word meanings are simply 
              explained, and see that, even if children can read for themselves, 
              they are questioned about what they have read or allowed to discuss 
              it, and not just left to get on alone. Even when children become 
              expert at word attack, their reading matter needs to be graded for 
              content difficultly and vocabulary. It must be emphasised that no 
              one stops learning to read. Even the most expert can improve their 
              speed, vocabulary, ability to skim, to find main points, to summarise 
              and evaluate, and so on. If children do make good progress in the 
              early skills, it is vital to build upon and continue this work, 
              so that the initial progress is not lost later.</p>
