            <p class="MPCtext">The aim 
              of this book has been to explain a new but very simple idea in such 
              a way that anyone interested will have no difficulty in understanding 
              and using it. Judging by the large number of teachers who have been 
              able to experiment with MPC after reading only two or three pages 
              of information and ideas, it has shown itself to be readily understood. 
              It is to be hoped that the extra information and suggestions included 
              here will make it easier for those who are less enterprising or 
              experienced, and also benefit the pioneers by sharing the many ideas 
              which have been found successful in one way or another.</p>
              
              <p class="MPCtext">One of the members of the Bullock Committee, whose Report has been 
              published since most of the experimental work was done on MPC, encourage 
              me to make this work available to teachers as worthwhile aid. The 
              following relevant recommendations are made in the Bullock Report.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="MPCtext">&#8217;56. There is no one method, medium, approach, device or philosophy 
              that holds the key to the process of learning to read.&#8217;
              </blockquote>
              <p class="MPCtext">I should like to emphasise that I agree wholeheartedly with this 
              statement. MPC is an aid, not a panacea.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="MPCtext">&#8217;60. The accurate perception of individual letters and groups 
              of letters is an important factor in learning to read. Young children 
              should be helped to learn the characteristics of letters through 
              a variety of games and activities, not through formal exercises.&#8217;</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p class="MPCtext">
              From the Report&#8217;s 333 recommendations I have selected those 
              which give most support to an aid like MPC. I agree with all the 
              rest and would work on language, encourage pre-reading skills, use 
              &#8216;cloze&#8217; or practise the use of context cues, teach for 
              a variety of comprehension skills and so on. It is in the area of 
              learning the sound-symbol relationships that MPC is most likely 
              to help. The release from drills and from detailed phonic work detached 
              from the normal reading context should allow more meaningful reading 
              and reduce frustration and discouragement. Moreover, it enables 
              pupils to do more for themselves, which could make all the difference 
              between wasting time waiting for attention and getting on with the 
              job of learning. Class organisation is simplified not only because 
              the children can work alone more easily but also because they can 
              start.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">It is often claimed that reading improvement resulting from intensive 
              help out of the classroom is not maintained on return. MPC allows 
              slower children to cope with work in the classroom and carry on 
              more normally, once they know the sounds, thus preventing any such 
              loss.</p>
             <p class="MPCtext">
              There is a fairly wide consensus of opinion today that teachers 
              who have expected their pupils to &#8216;pick things up&#8217; just 
              because the opportunity is there have been over-optimistic. There 
              could easily be a corresponding swing towards more formal methods 
              of teaching which, in fact, the majority have never abandoned. MPC 
              strikes a good balance here. Although there is a very clear sound-symbol 
              structure for which some direct teaching is needed, MPC very quickly 
              leads to more freedom, both in learning independently with the motivation 
              of success and interest and in using almost any reading materials 
              within the range of oral understanding. Freedom from the restrictions 
              of constant repetition for &#8216;look-say&#8217; word learning 
              as well as from the grading of phonic readers, starting with regular 
              three-letter words, allows for much more natural and easy writing.</p>
              <p class="MPCtext">
              Finally, perhaps the most vital consideration is the need for co-operation 
              between home and school. The child with someone who can hear him 
              read at home and who can understand and share in the aims of the 
              school will have a great advantage over the child who is entirely 
              dependent on what is learnt on the school premises. Although everyday 
              written language is not marked with cues, it is not in a different 
              script. The technique required to teach the MPC marks need not be 
              sophisticated. Any parent with a copy of the cue-card could do some 
              good by going through it to help the child learn the sounds. The 
              majority of parents who have spent a short time studying MPC could 
              easily use cues to regularise a word in a newspaper or book in order 
              to help a child read it. Beyond the classroom, it is also ideal 
              for amateur volunteers helping in adult literacy campaigns. </p>
              <p class="MPCtext">
              No other aid that I know of is so easy to learn and use. There is 
              so little to add to what is normally known and understood, yet it 
              can make a spectacular difference to the ease of reading and teaching 
              to read. If MPC can help even a few unhappy strugglers, something 
              will have been achieved.</p>

            <p class="MPCtitle">Appendix 1<a name="A1" id="A1"></a></p>
            <p class="MPCtext"><strong>Simple 
              games to reinforce learning sounds and early sight vocabulary</strong></p>
            <p class="MPCtext">Children 
              vary widely in the amount of repetition they need for anything to 
              be permanently memorised. Some need a great deal, however meaningful 
              and interesting the presentation or context. Such children are particularly 
              helped by games with a purpose, which provide motivation for learning 
              and involve repetition without boredom. If they are also self-checking, 
              they can be played while the teacher is occupied elsewhere, thus 
              stimulating independent learning.<br>
              1. <em>Flashcards</em>: group (Figure 9)<br>
              Aids the memory-bond between picture-cue and sound.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">Make 
              cards about 10 x 6 cm. On one side write a sound from the cue-card 
              in large print; on the other draw the corresponding picture. The 
              children are shown the picture and try to say its sound. The first 
              to do so takes the card and shows both sides to the group.<br>
              <br>
              At the end the child with most cards goes on to another activity, 
              while the rest repeat the game.<br>
              <br>
              These cards can also be used for games 2, 3 and 4, and for matching 
              to sounds in words and sentences on the wall or to a large cue-card.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext"><strong>Figure 
              9</strong></p>
            <p align="justify"><img src="images/figure/Fig_9.png" width="453" height="124"></p>
            <p class="MPCtext">2. <em>Guess 
              the sound</em>: pairs<br>
              Aids the recognition of symbol without picture.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">Both 
              children must be able to say a sound with its picture. One child 
              shows the picture (or sound) side of a card to the other, who has 
              to say its sound (or picture), and takes the card if right. The 
              children can take it in turns to select a card, change after a wrong 
              guess, or after each set.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">3. <em>Sound 
              pairs</em>: group<br>
              Matching recognition and the use of more than one sound-picture 
              combination are all involved.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">Add a 
              second set of cards with different pictures. (a) Both sets are spread 
              out, picture-side upwards. The children take it in turns to pick 
              a pair, checking by looking at the other side.<br>
              (b) One set is picture-side downwards. A pair consists of a sound 
              matched to a picture. The winner is the child with most pairs.<br>
              <br>
              4. <em>Sound Bingo</em>: group<br>
              This game encourages effort and quick response in recognising sounds.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">Divide 
              large cards into sections the same size as the flashcards. In each 
              section draw a sound corresponding to one of the flashcards. The 
              caller holds up a picture. The first child to recognise it as matching 
              a sound on their large card takes it to cover that sound. The first 
              to cover his or her large card wins. The large cards may be the 
              same or slightly different for each child.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">5. <em>Test 
              your friend</em>: pairs (Figure 10)<br>
              This is a useful and interesting method of self-checking, and involves 
              learning and correcting responses.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">Cut notches 
              in three sides of a piece of card about 12 cm square. The number 
              of notches depends on the number of sounds which need testing. Draw 
              a sound beside each notch and a corresponding picture on the reverse 
              of the card. The card is held upright between the children. The 
              one who can see the pictures say, for example, &#8216;Point to the 
              owl&#8217;. The other then has to place his finger or pencil in 
              the notch by the <img src="images/words/ow.png" width="22" height="15"> 
              sound. If correct, he takes a counter. Five cards, each with nine 
              sounds, will cover all the MPC symbols and could follow the same 
              progression as the MPC Workbooks.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext"><strong>Figure 
              10</strong></p>
            <p align="justify"><img src="images/figure/Fig_10.png" width="454" height="229"></p>
            <p class="MPCtext">6. <em>Spelling 
              the sounds</em>: pairs (Figure 11)<br>
              With the help of MPC cues, the varying spellings of vowel sounds 
              are introduced and learnt. Children should have reached lesson 14 
              of the <a href="resources.htm"><em>MPC Spelling Workbook</em></a>.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">Make 
              six cards each about 12 x 9 cm. Write one vowel sound clearly on 
              each card: <img src="images/words/a.png" width="10" height="14">,<img src="images/words/e.png" width="10" height="14">,<img src="images/words/i.png" width="9" height="17" align="bottom">, 
              <img src="images/words/o.png" width="10" height="14">, <img src="images/words/u.png" width="9" height="14"> 
              and <img src="images/words/oo.png" width="19" height="14">. On the 
              back of each card write a list of words containing the different 
              ways in which the sound on the front can be spelt, e.g. <img src="images/words/a.png" width="10" height="14">&#8212;<em>may, 
              cake, plaice, weigh</em>; <img src="images/words/oo.png" width="19" height="14">&#8212;<em>who, 
              through, shoe, blue</em>. Make a duplicate set. (a) One child lays 
              his cards down with the sounds showing. The other picks a word from 
              his cards and asks the first to find it by picking up the right 
              card from his own set. If he is right first time he gets a counter. 
              When he has five counters they change places.<br>
              (b) The first child asks the other to spell, for example, weigh. 
              After choosing the right card by the sound the other then reads 
              out the word and so gets a counter.<br>
              </p>

            <p class="MPCtext">7. <em>Word 
              recognition board game</em>: group<br>
              This aids learning the early sight vocabulary, using cued words 
              from the MPC Word List. A teacher must be present to ensure words 
              are correctly read.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">On a 
              piece of card about 40 x 50 cm draw a road on which are marked about 
              50 moves between Start and Home. Number six small containers (such 
              as margarine tubs) 1 to 6. In turn, the children throw a die and 
              take a word from the tub of that number. When they have read the 
              word correctly they move that number of spaces. The first to reach 
              Home is the winner. To add interest the board can be made into a 
              football game, race track, treasure hunt, etc. Hazards can be added, 
              e.g. Think squares: a tub labelled Think contains cars saying &#8216;Think 
              of three words beginning with p&#8217;, &#8216;Think of four words 
              ending with t&#8217;, etc. These are read by the teacher.

              as part of a series making full use of MPC as an aid to reading, 
              they could easily be used with more traditional methods. Only the

            <p class="MPCtext">The <a href="resources.htm"><em>MPC

              to form the letters from which they are made. It does not go through 
              them in alphabetical order, but starts with the consonants which 
              are most useful both as an aid to recognising words and in teaching 
              the correct movements. There is one representation of each of the 
              main sounds, e.g. <strong>ow</strong> but not<strong> ou</strong>. 
              The sounds <strong>ch</strong>, <strong>sh</strong>, <strong>ng</strong>, 
              etc. are included since these are regular in use. Children should

              focus a simple, lively illustration. Some direction and help are 
              needed from the teacher, firstly in reading the sentence and then 
              in discussing it with the pupils to encourage language and ensure 
              that print is always associated with meaning and interest. The <em>sound 
              </em>of the letters is then pointed out and its association with 
              the symbol emphasised. The letter-names should not be taught at 
              this stage. The teacher should supervise the pupil&#8217;s writing 
              movements before leaving him to work alone, since this will avoid 
              much trouble later. At the bottom of each page are suggestions for 
              further, more open-ended activities designed to reinforce learning.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">The<em> 
              <a href="resources.htm">MPC Spelling Workbook</a></em> teaches the 
              main rules and exceptions of English spelling, clearly shown with 
              the help of MPC. Each rule is presented with examples and practical 
              reinforcement in the form of activities, so that the pupil learns 
              to spell through experience. A vocabulary of about 150 words is 
              necessary before beginning this workbook.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">The <em><a href="resources.htm">MPC 
              Word List</a></em> is a simple dictionary containing over 600 of 
              the words most commonly used in early reading with cues. Space is 
              provided for the pupil to add new words. Once pupils know the sounds 
              and cues, they will be able to read and learn the words and so recognise 
              them in their books. It is hoped that this will help to deal with 
              the two great problems encountered by those teaching reading to 
              beginners: hearing pupils and giving them words for writing. By 
              allowing the pupils greater independence, the <em>MPC Word List</em> 
              will save the teacher time while laying the foundations for a thorough 
              linguistic understanding of phonemegrapheme correspondence.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext"><em>MPC 
              Checklists</em>, found on the last page of each book.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">The <a href="resources.htm"><em>MPC 
              Reading workbook</em></a> checklist lists the sounds covered in 
              the book and provides space to record the pupil&#8217;s progress: 
              <em>knows sound</em> with <em>picture cue</em>; <em>know sound without 
              picture cue</em>. There is also space for fuller notes on each sound.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">The <a href="resources.htm"><em>MPC 
              Spelling Workbook</em></a> checklist list the rules or skills covered 
              in the book, indexed by lesson number. It can thus also be used 
              as a list of contents. Since the workbook deals with the understanding 
              of English spelling in principle, rather than with learning actual 
              examples of words, the checklist is designed to record that each 
              page has been worked through and understood. The pupil may have 
              to do a page more than once, so it is suggested that three marks 
              be used to show his progress: mark <img src="images/figure/tick_end.png" width="20" height="20" align="absbottom">doing 
              this page, tick<img src="images/figure/tick.png" width="20" height="20" align="absbottom"> 
              page completed with understanding, <img src="images/figure/cross.png" width="20" height="20" align="absbottom"> 
              success in later revision test. Understanding of the <em>MPC Spelling 
              Workbook</em> can also be tested using the quiz on page 55. This 
              can be done as a game by the pupils or used as a method of testing 
              by the teacher.</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">The <em>MPC 
              Word List</em> checklist is intended as a record of progress in 
              using sounds and cues. There are six columns: <em>First Sounds, 
              Second Sounds, Blends, Simple Words, Using Cues, Syllables and Endings</em>. 
              At the head of each column is a star which should be coloured in 
              when the work in that column is complete. The teacher could have 
              a master copy of the checklist column is complete. The teacher could 
              have a master copy of the checklist with the same headings but with 
              the pupil&#8217; names some the side. The stars could then be entered 
              against the names, so helping to group the pupils.<br>
