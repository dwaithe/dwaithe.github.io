<font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Introduction </strong></font> 
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Teachers are constantly 
  looking for ways of helping their pupils, particularly to increase their independence 
  and skill in aiding their own learning and in being able to read alone. A great 
  deal of personal contact with the teacher is required before a child can read 
  instructions and produce written answers. Should this be given by addressing 
  the whole class and directing them all in the same piece of work? Should the 
  children be grouped, with only one section at a time enjoying the teacher&#8217;s 
  whole attention, or should this contact be as far a possible on an individual 
  basis? Whatever means are used, a great deal more learning takes place when 
  children can work on their own and are motivated to do so.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a teacher of infants, 
  I constantly exercised all my ingenuity to provide self-checking activities 
  for the &#8216;other group&#8217; while teaching something new to some of the 
  children. As a teacher of mixed ability Junior classes and rural classes with 
  a wide age-range, I was most worried by the slower children as it was difficult 
  to keep them well occupied in useful learning while others received my main 
  attention. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In training students 
  to teach infants, I am frequently asked how to &#8216;give children words&#8217; 
  for writing without long queues forming or children wasting time. Another common 
  problem is how to hear each child read frequently while dealing with all the 
  other activities of the classroom. Bright children with good home support frequently 
  work well on their own because they have early success and are encouraged by 
  it. Lack of success puts children off and they lose interest in the task for 
  its own sake. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">English spelling 
  is known to be a source of difficulty in learning to read. For a start, there 
  are about forty-four main sounds in the language, but only twenty-six letters 
  in the alphabet. Berkiansky (1969) worked with a group studying phonics. They 
  identified sixty-nine letters representing single sounds and seventy-nine different 
  ways of spelling the six vowels &#8216;a&#8217;, &#8216;e&#8217;, &#8216;i&#8217;, 
  &#8216;o&#8217;, &#8216;u&#8217; and &#8216;y&#8217;. More than one in ten common 
  words were exceptions to any rule and 166 rules had to be devised to cover the 
  remaining 5431 words in their sample taken from early reading books. No wonder 
  some teachers have thought that whole-word learning was better than attempting 
  phonics! Yet some ability to attack words not learnt as wholes is absolutely 
  necessary, or we are faced with the even more formidable task of memorising 
  thousands of whole words before we can read very much.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Minimal phonic cues 
  (MPC) solves this initial, basic problem by providing a simple and easily-learnt 
  method of word attack. This book presents a variety of ideas for using MPC, 
  which aims to lighten the task of learning to read by giving early success and 
  independence, two conditions vital to further progress.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>NB</strong> Throughout this 
  book the teacher is referred to as &#8216;she&#8217; and the pupil as &#8216;he&#8217;. 
  This purely for convenience. Everything said is of course addressed to teachers 
  of both sexes and refers to both girls and boys.<br>

<p><strong><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The irregularity 
  of English spelling</font></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Minimal Phonic 
  Cues</strong> aims to provide an accurate means of representing the written 
  word and its pronunciation at the same time. Many attempts have been made to 
  do this, since spelling irregularities cause so much extra trouble to those 
  learning to read English. The names of the letters have never been a great deal 
  of help and nearly all teachers now use phonic sounds. The problem is that although 
  simple sounds help in decoding many words, there are still difficulties with 
  sounds made from two letters, like &#8216;ch&#8217; and even more with the combinations 
  like &#8216;igh&#8217; and &#8216;tion&#8217;, and with the variable vowels 
  such as the letter &#8216;a&#8217; in <em>hat, make, call calm, paw, pail</em> 
  and so on.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bernard Shaw tried 
  to persuade us to adopt a new, simplified alphabet. As he said, you might say 
  the imaginary word &#8216;ghoti&#8217; spells &#8216;fish&#8217;-&#8216;gh&#8217; 
  as in<em> tough</em>, &#8216;o&#8217; as in <em>women</em>, and &#8216;ti&#8217; 
  as in <em>action</em>. More recently the initial teaching alphabet (i.t.a) was 
  devised. This includes most of the lower-case English letters, together with 
  a large number of new forms. While apparently giving help to many children and 
  teachers, the great i.t.a. experiment has been criticised for the need to change 
  to a slightly different script later and for not starting with normal English 
  spelling. Various other ideas have been tried, including colour codes and diacritical 
  marks over letters. In all these quite a lot has to be learnt before the system 
  can be fully used, and no system gives a guide which is reliable for every word.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MPC, on the other 
  hand, gives a reliable guide to every single word. It is not dependent on colour, 
  it does not interfere with normal print and it is extremely simple and easy 
  to use. There is no single, prescribed way of applying the scheme. Its use is 
  determined by the methods of the teacher and the needs of the children. This 
  flexibility is one of its greatest advantages, allowing MPC to be effectively 
  used with a wide variety of ages and situations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>How MPC deals with spelling 
  irregularities</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MPC starts by analysing 
  all the main English sounds and providing one symbol for each, without using 
  any new letter-shapes (see Figure1). Although both &#8216;c&#8217; and &#8216;x&#8217; 
  can be represented by &#8216;k&#8217; and &#8216;s&#8217;, and so are not really 
  needed, they are included so that the whole alphabet is shown. Double letters 
  (or digraphs) like &#8216;sh&#8217; and &#8216;ng&#8217; are linked by a slur 
  e.g. &#8216;<img src="images/words/sh.png" width="17" height="16"> &#8217;, 
  &#8216;<img src="images/words/ng.png" width="18" height="18" align="absbottom">&#8217;. 
  The &#8216;hard&#8217; vowel sounds are shown by a bar over the top e.g. &#8216;<img src="images/words/a.png" width="10" height="14">&#8217;, 
  &#8216;<img src="images/words/e.png" width="10" height="14" align="bottom">&#8217;. 
  The sound &#8216; <img src="images/words/air.png" width="19" height="16">&#8217; 
  has been included, because there is only one &#8216;r&#8217; sound. The &#8216;si&#8217;, 
  as in television, could be shown by &#8216;zy&#8217; above it. The &#8216;cue-card&#8217; 
  below gives a picture as a guide or mnemonic for each of the forty-five sounds. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Figure 1</strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/Cue%20card/cue-card.png" width="483" height="418"> 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Once these basic sounds and symbols can be recognised and the skill of blending 
  into words is acquired, there are only two other small signs to learn. Any English 
  word can be decoded without difficulty. A cross is placed over silent letters, 
  and a subsitution sound over any which cannot be regularised otherwise, e.g. 
  &#8216;<img src="images/words/come.png" width="40" height="17">&#8217;. Though 
  so simple, this works for<em> every</em> word.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  The only other question is how to teach capitals. Many of them can be recognised 
  by their similarity to the lower-case letters, and a substitution can be used 
  to deal with the others, as in &#8216;<img src="images/words/cue%20card.png" width="54" height="21" align="baseline">&#8217;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><br>
  Dialect and MPC</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dialect may cause some problems, 
  mainly with the pronunciation of &#8216;a&#8217; but MPC&#8217;s flexibility 
  can allow for this.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Teachers in some places, for example, Scotland, may find that some of the vowels 
  are marked in a way which does not correspond to Scottish children&#8217;s pronunciation. 
  The &#8216;oo&#8217; sound, for example in the word &#8216;good&#8217;, is more 
  like &#8216;<img src="images/words/u.png" width="9" height="14">&#8217; in Southern 
  English and &#8216;you&#8217; is also pronounced differentially. The sounds 
  &#8216;ur&#8217;, &#8216;or&#8217;, &#8216;au&#8217; and &#8216;o&#8217; may 
  also cause some difficulty, probably because the &#8216;r&#8217; is sounded 
  so much more strongly in Scottish accents. Where such teachers are adapting 
  MPC to suit their own needs, as advised here, they should use whatever parts 
  of the scheme are helpful and modify those which are note. A slightly different 
  cue-card, omitting a sound like &#8216;<img src="images/words/er.png" width="16" height="15">&#8217; 
  and perhaps altering &#8216;<img src="images/words/oo.png" width="19" height="14">&#8217; 
  and &#8216;<img src="images/words/oo-slur.png" width="19" height="15">&#8217;, 
  might thus be appropriate. When words are being marked in books, MPC can be 
  used to make them sound as similar to the normal pronunciation as possible. 
  </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  The main difference found in other English accents is between &#8216;a&#8217; 
  and &#8216;ah&#8217; in words like <em>dance</em>, <em>park</em> and <em>ask</em>. 
  Here the teacher should omit &#8216;ah&#8217; from the cue-card if it is never 
  used and, of course leave the &#8216;a&#8217; uncued in words like <em>dance</em>. 
  In the south one would cue &#8216;<img src="images/words/park.png" width="32" height="25" align="absbottom">&#8217; 
  and &#8216;<img src="images/words/fast.png" width="28" height="22" align="bottom">&#8217; 
  and son on if this were found to help reading. No change in cues is necessary 
  for other vowel forms, for example, if a Cockney child sounds &#8216;nice&#8217; 
  as &#8216;noice&#8217; because the child&#8217;s response to &#8216;<img src="images/words/i.png" width="9" height="17">&#8217; 
  will always be rat like &#8216;<img src="images/words/oi.png" width="13" height="18">&#8217;, 
  as it would be in normal script. Similarly, in the Midlands the common pronunciation 
  of &#8216;but&#8217; is more like the Southern &#8216;<img src="images/words/boot.png" width="32" height="15">&#8217;. 
  It need not be cued, however, because the response to &#8216;u&#8217; will always 
  be &#8216;<img src="images/words/oo-slur.png" width="19" height="15">&#8217;. 
  The same applies to &#8216;mother&#8217; which could be cued either as &#8216;<img src="images/words/mother_1.png" width="51" height="17">&#8217; 
  or &#8216;<img src="images/words/mother_2.png" width="51" height="20">&#8217; 
  if necessary.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Today accents are usually left alone so long as speech is clear and understandable. 
  The influences of radio and television mean that extremes of accent making a 
  person from say, Devon unintelligible in Yorkshire are rare. However if a child 
  could only communicate with local people he would be at a disadvantage for educational 
  purposes. However musical and interesting such an accent might be, the case 
  for preserving it intact is not strong. Many children learn one accent for school 
  and another for home. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  MPC can help to define the sounds to be considered in any informed discussion 
  of accent, though it provides no absolute pronunciation for them as does the 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">International 
  Phonetic Alphabet</a> (IPA). This is thus a better system for dealing with details 
  of accent.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Of a number of teachers who tried MPC throughout the British Isles very few 
  reported any snags. The main comments were from Scotland, as outlined above. 
  If there were too many difficulties of accent you might decide that MPC was 
  inappropriate for your pupils. However, the flexibility of the system means 
  that it can easily be adapted to suit individual requirements, or used only 
  in part. MPC is above all, a practical aid, designed to be of the maximum possible 
  use with the minimum amount of detail. Any cue can be used, so long as it enables 
  the child to make a better attempt at recognising the word and pronouncing it 
  in the way which is natural to him (Unless his normal speech is very defective).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Dealing with difficult vowels</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of MPC&#8217;s 
  most useful features is the way in which it deals with combinations of two vowel 
  symbols which can be sounded in various ways. Usually one of the letters represents 
  the right sound in either its phonic or letter-name form. A cross or a mark 
  and, occasionally, a substitution regularise all cases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Figure 2 </strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/figure/Fig_2.png" width="462" height="107"></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are also many 
  ways of pronouncing the same letter, e.g. &#8216;a&#8217; and &#8216;o&#8217; 
  in Figure 3 &#8216;o&#8217; is used in six different words with different effects. 
  MPC makes it possible to regularise the pronunciation by showing how &#8216;o&#8217; 
  is sounded, either alone or combined with another letter.</font></p>

  words and marks.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/figure/Fig_5.png" width="527" height="207"></font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several points can 
  be dealt with using Figure 5.<br>
  1. Although this example is fully and logically cued throughout it is unlikely 
  that any reader would need &#8216;the&#8217; cued every time. Too many marks 
  look confusing. However, if it <em>is</em> thought necessary to use cues on 
  every word they should be faintly marked, so that they can be used if needed 
  but ignored if not.<br>
  <br>
  2. The cross which shows a letter is unsounded has been put over one of the 
  repeated letters in &#8216;hill&#8217; and &#8216;hurried&#8217;. Some teachers 
  consider that this is unnecessary, as it probably is for word recognition. However, 
  since using single instead of double letters is a common spelling fault, it 
  is worth using the cross to help children remember which words contain double 
  letters. It is also useful sometimes when marking passages for word study.<br>
  <br>
  3. The cross for unsounded letters is also used to deal with the sound &#8216;schwa&#8217; 
  in the International Phonetic Alphabet. It cannot be designated using normal 
  letter symbols, on which MPC is based, except possibly by &#8216;uh&#8217;. 
  It occurs with several vowel spellings, but is more or less the same sound in 
  <em>children</em>, <em>to</em>, <em>the</em>, <em>correct</em>, <em>majestic</em> 
  and <em>succeed</em>, for example. The sounds &#8216;o&#8217;, &#8216;a&#8217; 
  and &#8216;u&#8217; in <em>correct</em>, <em>majestic</em> and <em>succeed</em> 
  do not really need to be cued because they are recognisable when the word is 
  pronounced slowly and carefully and only change to &#8216;uh&#8217; at speed. 
  Because the sounds &#8216;e&#8217; in <em>the</em> and &#8216;o&#8217; in <em>to</em> 
  are not like those in pen and <em>top</em>, they logically need cues (though 
  these are among the first words to be learnt and should not need making for 
  long, if at all). If consistency is necessary for word study the required effect 
  will be achieved by putting a cross above the letter which is not to be sounded. 
  &#8216;Th&#8217;,&#8216;t&#8217; and &#8216;children&#8217; are how we really 
  pronounce &#8216;the&#8217;, &#8216;to&#8217; and &#8216;children&#8217;.<br>
  <br>
  This is a practical help to those children who would otherwise pronounce every 
  bit of a word and end up with something less like its real pronunciation. It 
  has been shown to work well in practice, especially in longer words.<br>
  <br>
  4. There are two regular spellings for the same sound in &#8216;ow&#8217; and 
  &#8216;ou&#8217;, &#8216;aw&#8217; and &#8216;au&#8217;, &#8216;oi&#8217; and 
  &#8216;oy&#8217;. &#8216;Ah&#8217; and &#8216;ar&#8217; are alike in some accents 
  and &#8216;er&#8217;, &#8216;ir&#8217; and &#8216;ur&#8217; are alike in most 
  (except Scottish). Finer differences, not important for decoding meaning, are 
  ignored in MPC. Because the system aims to simplify the initial stages of reading 
  the cue-card shows only one symbol for each of these sounds. This should be 
  learnt first and used to substitute over the others so that they can be learnt 
  incidentally in the course of reading. &#8216;Er; and &#8217;oi&#8217; are definitely 
  more common that &#8216;ir&#8217; and &#8216;oy&#8217;. I decided to use &#8216;ow&#8217; 
  rather than &#8216;ou&#8217; and &#8216;au&#8217; rather than &#8216;aw&#8217; 
  on the cue-card, though since the word <em>house</em> is often used at an early 
  stage some teachers might prefer to use &#8216;ou&#8217; and &#8216;aw&#8217;. 
  This isn&#8217;t really important. What<em> is</em> important is that one or 
  the other should be chosen initially. The teacher can point out the similarity 
  at a very early stage and stop using a substitution. <br>
  <br>
  Substitutions may not be necessary for bright children who can soon learn several 
  possibilities, but those who are slow or young will probably need them. MPC 
  gives such pupils the smallest possible initial learning load so that the rest 
  of the phonic work is encountered in the course of reading and can be learnt 
  incidentally as far as possible. The <font color="#FF0000"><em>MPC Spelling 
  Workbook</em></font> is designed to reinforce and consolidate these rules. Once 
  they are known, the aid can be discarded. There is not a set scheme for dispensing 
  with certain things at each stage because needs will vary from child to child 
  and class to class. Completely individual discarding of cues would be difficult 
  within a class, but children will neglect them when they no longer need them 
  and so provide their own grading to some extent.<br>

  <font size="7">2</font> <font size="5"><strong>Ideas for adapting and using 
  MPC</strong></font></font></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How can you, the 
  teacher, use MPC? There is no set scheme for its use because so many teachers 
  have found its flexibility to be one of MPC&#8217;s great advantages. However, 
  this book is accompanied by the <em><font color="#FF0000">MPC Word List</font></em>, 
  which contains over 6000 cued words, the <em><font color="#FF0000">MPC Reading 
  Workbook</font></em> and the <em><font color="#FF0000">MPC Spelling Workbook</font></em> 
  (see Appendix 2). As their titles suggest, these are designed for individual 
  use by the pupils to aid and reinforce their learning. These two workbooks and 
  simple dictionary provide a phonic scheme which can be used to extend and accompany 
  other work in reading. The skills learnt from using these books will aid both 
  the sight learning of common words and the attack and spelling of new ones.</font></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>An aid to spelling and pronunciation</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In contrast to the 
  limited choice of reading material found in set reading schemes, <em>any</em> 
  passages can be marked with MPC. The boundless range thus offered means that 
  learners can absorb the relationships between spelling and pronunciation, using 
  MPC to aid in the decoding of new words, while reading really interesting material. 
  No formal phonic instruction is necessary once the forty-five sounds and the 
  skill of blending have been learnt. Spelling-pronunciation relationships can 
  then be learnt as are grammatical forms, mainly through unconscious absorption. 
  For example if &#8216;<img src="images/words/bright.png" width="41" height="20" align="absbottom">&#8217;, 
  &#8216;<img src="images/words/sight.png" width="36" height="20" align="absbottom">&#8217;, 
  &#8216;<img src="images/words/light.png" width="31" height="20" align="absbottom">&#8217;, 
  &#8216;<img src="images/words/night.png" width="36" height="20" align="absbottom">&#8217; 
  are continually encountered when reading, the deduction that &#8216;igh&#8217; 
  is pronounced &#8216;<img src="images/words/i.png" width="9" height="17">&#8217; 
  seems inevitable. At the same time the pupil is taking an interest in what he 
  is reading, other context cues are present and, because there is not hold-up 
  over difficult words, fluency is being developed. Moreover, MPC continually 
  highlights the relationships between sound and spelling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>An aid to finding out new 
  words</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What does the pupil 
  usually do when stuck on a word? He can ask, &#8220;What&#8217;s that word?&#8221; 
  and be told. Sometimes, instead of saying the word, the teacher might encourage 
  a guess from the context: &#8220;What could it be? What is she doing?&#8221; 
  or, &#8220;Well, what is that in the picture?&#8221; The pupil might be told 
  to read on and then might also say, &#8220;Try and build it up. Say the sounds.&#8221; 
  Unless the reading book is carefully graded for phonic difficulty, insistence 
  on a thorough attempt at building may easily result in &#8216;t-h-o-r-o-u-g-h&#8217;. 
  This is not much help unless many rules and blends are already known, because 
  the single letter-sounds are not always a good guide.<br>
  <br>
  The wise teacher will probably suggest a guess from context, checked by the 
  main consonant sounds, as a useful compromise. For instance, if a pupil reads 
  &#8216;He wanted a bike&#8217; when the text is &#8216;He roda a bike&#8217;, 
  the &#8216;r&#8217; and &#8216;d&#8217; in &#8216;rode&#8217; could be pointed 
  out and another guess suggested. However, this approach requires good language 
  experience in the pupil and good teaching ability in the teacher, as well as 
  time and individual attention. A pupil soon loses interest if he has to keep 
  stopping, and in many cases will not be able to read at all unless the teacher 
  is hearing him.<br>
  <br>
  The situation will be very different if the pupil knows the sounds and cues 
  of MPC. He will not use the cues for words he knows, but coming to &#8216;<img src="images/words/rode.png" width="32" height="16">&#8217; 
  will be able to say it straight away, without asking anybody, or losing the 
  meaning of the sentence by stopping. It is just as effective as if the teacher 
  was beside him saying, &#8220;You don&#8217;t sound the &#8216;e&#8217; but 
  it makes the &#8216;o&#8217; sound &#8216;<img src="images/words/o.png" width="10" height="14">&#8217;&#8221;, 
  and is certainly quicker. I have heard children using MPC get the word almost 
  immediately without even having to say the sounds aloud.<br>
  <br>
  Experiments show that MPC not only aids fluency and independence, but also, 
  because it leaves the word-shape unaltered (unlike<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet"> 
  i.t.a.</a>), constantly presents the sound-symbol relationship to the child.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Methods of presenting MPC 
  without printed materials</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, good teachers 
  have all sorts of ways to prevent children getting stuck or discouraged. Some 
  see that all or most of the new words to be met are learnt beforehand through 
  flashcards, games and drill in which interest is provided by the competition 
  or puzzle element. These may be individual or group activities (see Appendix 
  1). Cues can be used in preliminary work of this kind if books cannot be marked. 
  One way of doing this is to write the same word on both sides of a flashcard 
  and add cues to one side. The cued words can be shown first and their structure 
  pointed out, e.g. &#8216;should&#8217; is made up from &#8216;<img src="images/words/sh.png" width="17" height="16">&#8217;, 
  not &#8216;s-h&#8217;, and &#8216;ould&#8217;, pronounced &#8216;<img src="images/words/ood.png" width="27" height="14">&#8217;. 
  This is easily seen when cued. The structure could be made more obvious by asking 
  the pupils to find smaller words within the word, e.g. in &#8216;become&#8217;. 
  They may already know &#8216;be&#8217; and &#8216;come&#8217;, but if not, the 
  marks will help them to remember how they sound, e.g. &#8216;<img src="images/words/come.png" width="40" height="17">&#8217;. 
  In marking a word like &#8216;become&#8217; it might be more accurate to put 
  &#8216;<img src="images/words/become.png" width="58" height="19">&#8217;, but 
  it is best to use the letters which are already there as far as possible if 
  this gives a sufficient guide, e.g. &#8216;<img src="images/words/become_2.png" width="58" height="17">&#8217;. 
  It must be stressed once again that there is no absolutely right or wrong way 
  of marking any word. The teacher must use MPC as it is most helpful to her pupils, 
  discarding and adapting as necessary. Separating words or syllables with strokes 
  also helps to make the structure more obvious, but would probably prove rather 
  distracting if done on books.<br>
  <br>
  Having gone through a few cued words in this way, the children will enjoy trying 
  to remember them when shown the uncued side of each flashcard. I have found 
  from experience that this really amuses and interests them. Moreover, because 
  they have built up and can reconstruct the words for themselves, the children 
  will remember them far better than if they had simply been told them by the 
  teacher.<br>
  <br>
  Another variation on this idea is to give children the words of a new book written 
  on small cards, again cued on one side and not on the other. I found this most 
  effective with a group of backward seven-year-olds. They put their words in 
  a tin and, after going through them once at school, took them home. The MPC 
  marks are so simple parents learn them very quickly and can then help their 
  children with them. If the sounds are already thoroughly learnt the children 
  can work out what the new words are. They then really enjoy the puzzle of trying 
  to read the uncued words and only looking at the other side if they are stuck. 
  Some children using MPC in this way were overheard saying:&#8221; No, don&#8217;t 
  turn it over yet. I think I can get it.&#8221; I think I know what it is but 
  I&#8217;m not telling yet. I&#8217;ll turn it over first and see if I&#8217;m 
  right (Turns it.) Yes, I&#8217;m right. It&#8217;s --------.&#8221; One child, 
  whom I met in the street during the holidays, said, &#8220; I don&#8217;t half 
  like them words. I do &#8216;em every night.&#8221;<br>
  <br>
  Of course, the way one teaches and the relationship one builds up with pupils 
  will affect the result, but there does seem to be something about using MPC 
  which appeals as a kind of game. The child is motivated not just by wanting 
  to win a competitive game, but also by an individual challenge which stimulates 
  thought. Moreover, MPC is not separate from reading.<br>
  <br>
  Having studied individual words in this way, the child is delighted to find 
  that the next book in the reading scheme can be read fluently. This achievement 
  provides further encouragement.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Work with infants</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One experiment was 
  carried out with a middle and top Infants group over the nine months from the 
  autumn half-term till July. Bookmarks, made from thin strips of a card on which 
  new words were written with cues, were duplicated to provide a thorough and 
  systematic progress through a whole reading scheme. Most published readers give 
  lists of new words encountered. The words in these lists were arranged to fit 
  the size of bookmark, so the first one covered pages 1-10, the second pages 
  11-24, etc., according to the number of words needed. Large print was used for 
  the letters, so that they could be cued easily and be seen clearly by the children. 
  A set of wall pockets was made to hold the bookmarks in sets, there being three 
  or four bookmarks for each book. When a child finished a bookmark, it was put 
  back in the right pocket and the child could sign his name on a list attached, 
  which acted as a simple and effective means of recording progress. When he had 
  a new book mark the teacher went through it with him, seeing that he could work 
  out the words. There was no difficulty if the sounds were thoroughly known; 
  the child could look up the cued version of a new word on his bookmark instead 
  of having to ask the teacher. However, because normal reading methods were being 
  used alongside MPC, some children were reading books before they had learnt 
  the sounds properly, and so needed help. This is also a good way of using cues 
  without marking books.<br>
  <br>
  From this experiment, I feel that most children under six are better using whole-word 
  learning and making sure of the sounds in various ways so that they can analyse 
  later. Some are still at the intuitive stage and not ready for exact analysis, 
  but are in various stages of pre-reading. They may use MPC in an unanalytical 
  way. For example, when confusing &#8216;<img src="images/words/this%20is.png" width="41" height="17">&#8217; 
  with &#8216;<img src="images/words/here%20is.png" width="49" height="16">&#8217;, 
  as so may do, they may say to themselves &#8220;&#8217;here&#8217; has a cross 
  at the end. I&#8217;ll remember it by that. &#8220;This does no harm, whereas 
  forcing the child to use the cues properly is more likely to confuse than help. 
  Children are bothered by &#8216;funny marks they can&#8217;t understand&#8217;, 
  so professional judgement is needed as to when to start.<br>
  <br>
  My own experience leads me to think that, while the child can start learning 
  individual sounds very young, analysing and synthesising are linked with the 
  ability to perceive the relationships between a whole and its parts. This ability 
  can be assessed using Piaget&#8217;s tests with something like wooden beads 
  of two colours. See what answers a child gives when asked, &#8220;Are all the 
  red beads made of wood? Are all the wooden beads red?&#8221; Or do the experiment 
  with two equal-sized pens. Put them one above the other and say, &#8220;Are 
  they the same length?&#8221; Then move one part to the side and say, &#8220;Are 
  they still the same?&#8221; Children who can only take one side into account, 
  or one factor at a time, are going to be more confused than helped by phonic 
  analysis. Yet knowing letter-sounds, and so with what sounds a word begins or 
  ends, will help their reading by giving them extra clues to the words.<br>
  <br>
  The teacher should thus concentrate on plenty of spoken language, some whole-word 
  and sentence reading, paying attention to pre-reading skills and to learning 
  of sounds and letters representing them. When the sounds are known and understood 
  MPC can be used for rapid progress and independence.<br>

<p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Work with older slow-learners</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the majority 
  of poor readers of seven or over, sight-learning of whole words is not the answer. 
  They must acquire some skills of word-attack. They are often discouraged and 
  difficult to interest or to persuade to concentrate, and will, of course, have 
  all sorts of problems and reasons for backwardness, which may need investigation. 
  This aspect will not be examined here, as it is thoroughly dealt with in so 
  many other books. It should be stressed that if any teacher is so inexperienced 
  as to think that one method or idea is going to wipe out all problems she will 
  be disappointed, and I would be the last to suggest that MPC or any other idea 
  will do this. However, they may help in some cases and the teacher should therefore 
  be aware of all possible approaches. Of course, much training and skill is still 
  necessary to know what to do and when and how to do it.<br>
  <br>
  MPC&#8217;s advantage for slow or backward Junior or Secondary children is mainly 
  that phonic experience can develop through reading in context, with only the 
  forty-five sounds-symbols to be memorised. Memory, which is so often faulty 
  in these children, can be supplemented by reasoning when MPC is used. The infallibility 
  of the scheme is a great relief to such pupils, and boost their confidence immensely. 
  Years ago, when I was trying to help slow Juniors, I had to keep apologising 
  to them for the irregularities of our spelling. I tried to teach them to think, 
  and then they would say, for example, &#8220; You told us the &#8216;e&#8217; 
  at the end makes a vowel &#8216;say its name&#8217;. Why doesn&#8217;t it in 
  &#8216;gone&#8217; and &#8216;have&#8217;?! All I could say was, &#8220; I&#8217;m 
  sorry, but it doesn&#8217;t always work.&#8221; Some children can remember a 
  certain number of exceptions to rules, but after a certain pint they just give 
  up. An E.S.N school reported to me that the whole atmosphere there had changed 
  since they started using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">i.t.a.</a> 
  May boys who had given up trying and become disruptive found that they now had 
  a chance to succeed, and changed their attitude completely. For children such 
  as these to have to learn changed spellings later is an unnecessary burden when 
  MPC can have the same regularising benefits without altering normal spelling. 
  A teacher who had just explained MPC marks to a boy who already knew most of 
  the phonic sounds reports that, after trying it, he came running out to her 
  shouting, &#8220;It works&#8221; Another teacher remembers a boy in a similar 
  circumstances saying to her, &#8220;Why ever didn&#8217;t you tell me about 
  this before?&#8221;<br>
  <br>
  In <em>The Improvement of Reading</em> (McGraw Hill, 1967) Strang quotes a youth 
  at a clinic, who said, &#8220;There&#8217;s one thing I don&#8217;t like , when 
  you&#8217;re reading out loud and you come to a word and you can&#8217;t pronounce 
  it and the teacher tells me what it is.&#8221; The older and , possibly, the 
  more intelligent the slow reader is, the more he resents his inferiority and 
  lack of independence. Once he has learnt the MPC sounds and symbols and can 
  use them, he can read marked material without reference to the teacher, because 
  he can find out words for himself. This boosts confidence and also means he 
  can work without constant attention and help, which usually results in a lot 
  more being done and experience gained.<br>
  <br>
  Slow readers who have poor sight memory but are not too weak on reasoning or 
  sound discrimination are most likely to be helped by MPC. Once they have learnt 
  the system they can read marked workcards, which will sometimes enable them 
  to do the same work as better readers. It may also be helpful to mark difficult 
  words as they are encountered, either in the book or on a piece of fairly stiff 
  plastic which can be held over the page and marked in felt-tipped pen. This 
  is a good idea if you want to use MPC in books but cannot mark them.<br>
  <br>
  Teachers who <em>can</em> mark books may be unable to do so through lack of 
  time. This problem can be solved by adding cues to any word which children need 
  help when hearing them read. If this done continually, books will soon have 
  cues marked where necessary without any extra time having been spent doing it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Writing</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the advantages 
  cited by advocates of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">i.t.a.</a> 
  is that it enables young children to write freely, as they spell entirely by 
  sound. There is not doubt that such free writing is inhibited by the irregular 
  spelling of traditional orthography. One of the greatest problems when teaching 
  writing in t.o. is thus helping children with words. Usually they have to be 
  written by the teacher in individual wordbooks, and it is difficult to avoid 
  a queue waiting for this to be done. It is some help not to have too many children 
  writing at once, but if others are doing maths, need conversation or help with 
  making something, there is still a question of priorities. Teachers try to make 
  children be as independent as possible by encouraging them to try their own 
  version, to look up words on lists or in simple dictionaries, or by writing 
  up words likely to be needed beforehand. Another good idea is to give each child 
  a plain sheet of paper and a paperclip to attach it to his wordbook, and only 
  to help with a word when he has made an attempt on the paper. If the word is 
  right it is quicker just to say so, or there may be only one letter to alter.<br>
  <br>
  A child could also write using MPC sounds on the loose sheet in his wordbook 
  to be altered if necessary by the teacher, or ticked if correct, e.g. &#8216;<img src="images/words/having%20rit%20right.png" width="127" height="19" align="absbottom">&#8217;. 
  If a child can remember and spell words like &#8216;tea&#8217; and &#8216;came&#8217; 
  it is not necessary for him to put a cross over the unsounded letters when writing 
  (though this is a help when reading). I do not think it would be wise to encourage 
  children to write using MPC sounds alone when they did not know the correct 
  spelling. Fluency would certainly be increased, but this would result in &#8216;It 
  was my birthday yesterday and eight friends came to tea&#8217; being written 
  &#8216;<img src="images/words/it%20woz%20mi%20berthda.png" width="351" height="20" align="absbottom">&#8217;, 
  which I would not advocate. If a child had no means of finding the right spelling, 
  MPC would enable him to record the sound accurately, but spelling should be 
  as normally correct as possible from the start, even if it is a bit harder for 
  children to achieve.<br>
  <br>
  In writing, MPC can be used to aid in looking up the correct spelling. Learning 
  the alphabet order is important at this stage, but a child may still look up, 
  for example, &#8216;quiet&#8217; under &#8216;c&#8217; or &#8216;a&#8217;, or 
  not be sure if it is the word he wants because of irregular spelling. The MPC 
  Word List which accompanies this book contains over 600 of the words most commonly 
  used in early spelling together with cues. They are indexed under initial sound 
  as well as initial letter, so that, for example &#8216;phone&#8217; is found 
  under both &#8216;p&#8217; and &#8216;f&#8217;. Spelling and MPC is discussed 
  more fully in Chapter 4.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Language-experience approaches</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many teachers prefer 
  not to use a set reading scheme for beginners, but to let them make up their 
  own reading material in some way; <em>Breakthrough to Literacy</em> (Longman) 
  materials may be used, or children&#8217;s pictures with captions and simple 
  sentences written at their dictation and made into books. Wall-story techniques, 
  as explained by Goddard in <em>Reading in the Modern Infants School </em>(ULP, 
  1958), use a similar idea for group teaching. MPC can be used with any of these 
  approaches.<br>
  <br>
  My own experience here has been mainly with adult illiterates, for whom I found 
  it impossible to provide printed material at a level which did not insult their 
  intelligence, yet which was simple enough to read. They therefore dictated sentences 
  about their jobs, their cars, their families or anything else they liked, which 
  I wrote down on strips of card. They copied these into their books or had them 
  typed on a jumbo typewriter when available. Then they cut up the cards into 
  words, which they used for matching and making other sentences. Some record 
  of words known was needed. One good way to do this was to tick them off in a 
  500-word book or on a Ladybird <em>Key Words</em> list, adding them if they 
  were not on the list. Then, when the pupils were judged ready, cues were added 
  to the books or words to show the sound-symbol relationship.<br>
  <br>
  In some cases, cues were quickly understood and could then be widely used. In 
  others, much work of an intuitive nature without analysis was needed. The older 
  the pupils, the more diverse their problems and needs. Some, whose reasoning 
  is very poor, need much preliminary work before word attack is possible. Yet 
  I taught one man who was quite intelligent, with a reading age of about seven 
  and no idea of the sounds. He raced ahead using MPC, which he understood at 
  once.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Conclusion</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The range of ideas 
  suggested here will have given some idea of the great scope and flexibility 
  of MPC. To try it, there is no need to invest in any new or expensive materials. 
  It can be used in full or in part as needed. It could be used for only some 
  children in a class, without disruption. If a child started it and then changed 
  to a school or class where it was not used, the child might miss it, but would 
  not be at a disadvantage. It makes spelling better, not worse. There is no need 
  for a sudden changeover from using it, just a gradual disuse. By the time a 
  reading age of a about eight is attained MPC should not be needed, except for 
  some spelling practice and analysis of spelling rules <a href="link">(see Chapter 
  4)</a>. It allows phonic practice using reading matter which is not graded for 
  phonic simplicity and which can therefore be in completely natural language. 
  However, it should be remembered that children can cope much better with two-syllable 
  words than with words of three syllables or more. Vocabulary should be largely 
  within the child&#8217;s spoken vocabulary; words may be pronounced but not 
  understood when they are easy to read.<br>
  <br>
  MPC is most readily used to aid reading independence when there is some mental 
  maturity and ability to analyse. It would thus be ideal for reasonably intelligent 
  adults who speak, but cannot read English, as in some of the developing countries. 
  For such pupils cued books would be very useful, enabling independent reading 
  to take place quickly. <a href="link">Chapter 5</a> deals more fully with the 
  use of MPC in various situations and with different age-groups.<br>
  <br>
  It must be emphasised that MPC cannot be used effectively until the sounds have 
  been properly learnt. After that, rapid progress is possible. Preliminary attention 
  to learning the sounds and cues is therefore vital, and is dealt with in the 
  next chapter.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  <font size="7">3</font> <font size="5">Teaching the sounds and the skills of 
  bending and using cues</font></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It should now be 
  apparent that a thorough learning of individual sounds and symbols and the ability 
  to blend are essential before MPC can be properly and effectively used. It would 
  be interesting to see whether simply drilling the sounds, teaching how to blend 
  and use cues and then starting on cued reading material would work. After only 
  a short period of drilling there would be complete freedom to read anything. 
  However, this would be very unsophisticated and is not advised.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Teaching the basic phonic 
  sounds</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Infant classes 
  the normal or current programme of early reading should not be interfered with, 
  but learning sounds and their symbols should take place at the same time, perhaps 
  as a separate activity. Children should be shown how to form letters properly, 
  not just left to copy sentences written by the teacher. This is a good time 
  to teach the concepts represented by the symbols which they are learning to 
  write&#8217; to show that a<em> number</em> of words begin with &#8216;b&#8217; 
  and not just one on a chart, that although the second at the beginning of a 
  word is a good guide to it, the sound may also occur in the middle or at the 
  end of a word. Traditionally, children of three and four have had alphabet books 
  which taught them to say one letter at a time while looking at a picture connected 
  with it. If they learnt the phonic sounds in this way it would certainly do 
  no harm. But other considerations must be remembered: interest, meaning, concentration, 
  left-right sequence, language development, and the need to imporve visual and 
  aural discrimination and memory. Exercises may help any skill, but it is far 
  better if the skill can be combined with other activities or learnt, at least 
  in part, incidentally. It is like comparing the old method of learning music 
  by practising scales first with modern methods. The scales may be good thing 
  later, but could put the child off music altogether if done without meaning. 
  <br>
  <br>
  One way of teaching sounds with the maximum amount of meaning is to write labels 
  for the classroom which contain all the MPC sounds, making matching sentences, 
  matching words and also matching sounds of the same size. There is thus meaning 
  in every part. For example, I made labels on which the following sentences were 
  written with cues:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/words/Read%20quietly%20in%20this%20corner.png" width="243" height="214"></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  In line with the theory that the two main aspects of literacy are fact and fiction, 
  a wall-story was the next idea which I treated in this way. The children had 
  heard and enjoyed <em>The Gingerbread Boy</em> so a wall-story was made (rather 
  a long one, as some children were seven). A picture accompanied each sentence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/words/The%20farmer%27s%20wife%20was%20cooking.png" width="366" height="188"></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This was a popular 
  piece of equipment. The children enjoyed reading it, some more or less learning 
  it by heart and then learning to pick out the words. Once children also got 
  the idea of finding sounds, they became very interested in trying to match them 
  and would often do it on their own. With MPC every sound can be matched accurately, 
  and there is no confusion between &#8216;a&#8217;, &#8216;<img src="images/words/a.png" width="10" height="14" align="absmiddle">&#8217;, 
  &#8216;ah&#8217;, &#8216;au&#8217;, etc. Children can see for themselves if 
  there is a discrepancy between sound and spelling. Given suitable stimulus and 
  encouragement, much can be learnt from these matching activities, each sound 
  being in context both in a word and in a meaningful sentence. <br>
  <br>
  Because they take some time to make, it is tempting to leave one wall story 
  up for too long. It is advisable to change the story every week or so, since 
  once the freshness has gone it can easily be ignored and lose its value. We 
  replaced <em>The Gingerbread Boy</em> with <em>Jack and the Beanstalk</em>, 
  treated in the same way, with matching sentences, then words, then sounds. The 
  sentences were:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) Jack sold the 
  poor cow.<br>
  2) He got some magic beans.<br>
  3) They grew into a great beanstalk.<br>
  4) Jack climbed up to the giant&#8217;s house.<br>
  5) Fee, fi, fo, fum, yelled the giant.<br>
  6) Quick! Hide! Said the giant&#8217;s wife.<br>
  7) Where is my goose? Fetch her.<br>
  8) She laid a very large egg.<br>
  9) Oi, mother. Bring me my axe.<br>
  10) Down fell the giant with a crash.<br>
  <br>
  This also contains all the forty-five MPC sounds. When working out sentences 
  of this kind a few sounds are difficult to fit in, usually &#8216;x&#8217;, 
  &#8216;j&#8217; &#8216;oi&#8217; and &#8216;qu&#8217;, which are not so commonly 
  used. A little alteration may be necessary to include these. Here we change 
  &#8216;Hi, mother&#8217;, to &#8216;Oi, mother&#8217; because &#8216;oi&#8217; 
  did not appear anywhere else. It is better, though, to teach the less-used sounds 
  in some other way than by contriving unnatural sounding phrases.<br>
  Even with quite a lot of matching practice most children still need daily repetition 
  for symbols to be thoroughly known. It is rather like learning multiplication 
  tables. All kinds of activities ensure the concepts are understood, but there 
  is still the need to repeat and memorise later. Once the concepts of what sounds 
  are, and what they do, are known, the cue-card should be gone though daily, 
  with picture mnemonics, until the pictures can be discarded. Any other means 
  liked by the teacher, such as card games, <em>Breakthrough</em> phonic folders 
  (Longman) or Stott apparatus (Holmes-McDougall) can easily be adapted for MPC.<br>
  <br>
  The same wall-story technique could be used without MPC, but would have to use 
  matching letters, even if their sounds did not correspond, or be confined to 
  those that did correspond, perhaps just consonants. This does not have the same 
  value as MPC in pointing out the relationship between sound and spelling in, 
  for instance, the word &#8216;<img src="images/words/four.png" width="30" height="21" align="bottom">&#8217;, 
  where the vowel sound is irregular.<br>
  <br>
  The way in which MPC includes the digraphs &#8216;ch&#8217;, &#8216;sh&#8217;, 
  etc. in the early learning is also an important advantage. They are not more 
  difficult to learn if taught as one sound, and not knowing them is a source 
  of trouble. In one school which I was comparing with my experimental class I 
  found only single sounds had been learnt, and was told they &#8216;hadn&#8217;t 
  come to the others yet&#8217;. The linking of digraphs with a slur aids their 
  assimilation as one sound, but it is important that younger children should 
  realise that the slur is not part of the symbol. It should therefore be drawn 
  more faintly or in a different colour. Though colour makes cues more attractive 
  to the younger ones. It takes longer to do and is not really necessary. There 
  is no reason, however why a teacher should not use different colours if she 
  wants to do so in marking apparatus or books for those starting to learn to 
  read with MPC.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Adaptations 
  for older slow-learners</strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These examples of the matching labels 
  and wall-stories were made for older slow-learners and adults, and also include 
  all the sounds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) A crow sat on a high branch.<br>
  2) She had just found some cheese.<br>
  3) The fox looked up at her there.<br>
  4) Why are you so quiet? He said.<br>
  5) I am sure you can sing very well.<br>
  6) So the crow made a big noise.<br>
  7) The cheese fell out of her mouth.<br>
  8) The fox soon ate it and ran away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The next one was made up for an adult 
  class using a small, rather bare room.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) The window is made of glass.<br>
  2) Our tables are wooden ones.<br>
  3) The walls are plastered now.<br>
  4) These are light metal chairs.<br>
  5) This is a square shape.<br>
  6) These tables have been joined together.<br>
  7) You can keep things in here.<br>
  8) We sit where we choose.<br>
  9) Cards go in this box.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The labels could be arranged in place 
  at the start of a session. they may sound dull, but their down-to-earth, everyday 
  nature appealed to these slow-learners as something that made sense. The labels 
  could be fixed with Blu-tack and removed to be put away again. This is one way 
  of coping when using a room once or twice a week, which is also used by other 
  classes.<br>
  <br>
  Comic strip stories can be adapted in the same way to provide the interest of 
  fiction. A sixteen-year-old slow reader, who showed very little interest in 
  the books available, frequently brought in comics, whose lurid picture stories 
  he followed avidly. I realised that what he needed was action. With his help 
  I produced the sentences below, made out on cards for the <em>Language Master</em> 
  (Bell &amp; Howell) so that he could put them through and hear them in order. 
  Then I got him to match words and sounds, written on separate cards, and put 
  them in place on the sentence cards, using paperclips. When he could do this, 
  and had done other preliminary work, I gave him a tape of the cue-card to which 
  he could listen as he pointed to each sound.<br>
  <br>
  This particular boy had previously managed to learn most of the alphabet sounds, 
  and capital (but not small) letters. If he had been taught MPC from the start 
  I have no doubt that he could have read, using cues, in spite of his very limited 
  memory.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) This man went shooting tigers.<br>
  2) The tigers were very fierce.<br>
  3) They had gone far into the jungle.<br>
  4) The tigers were not frightened.<br>
  5) A tiger can kill a man.<br>
  6) Here is a big one coming now.<br>
  7) I&#8217;ll fix him, says the man.<br>
  8) He points his gun carefully.<br>
  9) Whizz! He has missed the tiger.<br>
  10) The tiger is chasing him now.<br>
  11) The man is climbing a tree.<br>
  12) But tigers know how to climb trees.<br>
  13) He has nearly got his paw to the man.<br>
  14) The man uses his gun quickly.<br>
  15) This time the tiger falls down dead.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is not easy to 
  get excitement and a sense of urgency into such simple writing, but it is worth 
  the effort if it arouses interest. MPC gives the great advantage of allowing 
  phonics to be studied using this kind of material, instead of &#8216;The dog 
  sat on the log&#8217; variety. To maintain interest, of course, a series of 
  stories would be needed, so that not too much time is spent on one story and 
  its analysis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following strip story is suitable 
  for any age. This also includes all the MPC sounds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) Meet the Smith family.<br>
  2) Mrs Smith is cooking the dinner.<br>
  3) Mr Smith is washing the car.<br>
  4) Jimmy is going to school.<br>
  5) Mary is playing in the garden.<br>
  6) Baby is crying in the pram.<br>
  7) The dog is asleep in his box.<br>
  8) Mrs Smith says, Dinner is ready now.<br>
  9) Mr Smith says, Quick! What have you got for us?<br>
  10) Jimmy says, I though we were having chops.<br>
  11) Mary says, I thought it was a joint of beef!<br>
  12) The baby is having some milk.<br>
  13) The dog has got a bone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Workcards were used to aid analysis 
  of this story, for example:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Find these silent letters <strong>e 
  n m h y a k o gh</strong><br>
  (They can be found in <em>were, dinner, Jimmy, school, playing, ready, quick</em> 
  and <em>thought</em>, as examples.)<br>
  Find these different sounds for letter <strong>a</strong>: o <img src="images/words/ah.png" width="18" height="17" align="bottom"> 
  <img src="images/words/air.png" width="19" height="16" align="baseline">(was, car, Mary); <strong>o</strong> 
  sounding u (some); <strong>o</strong> sounding oo (cooking)<br>
  The marks make these easy to see and provide and interesting puzzle element 
  for children ready to do some analysis.<br>
  <a href="link">Appendix 1</a> contains further simple games designed to give 
  practice in memorising the sounds and early sight vocabulary, so reinforcing 
  learning.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Starting MPC with children 
  who know most of the phonic sounds</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These children should 
  already know the short vowels and single consonants, which are exactly the same 
  in MPC and t.o.:<br>
  <strong>a e i o u</strong> as in <em>cat, get, tin, pot, cup</em><br>
  <strong>b c d f g h j k l m n p r s t v w x y z</strong> are all exactly the 
  same.<br>
  Consonant blends of digraphs may or may not be known, but should be checked: 
  <strong>qu, ng,</strong> <img src="images/words/th.png" width="14" height="17"> 
  (as in <em>they</em>), <img src="images/words/th_slur.png" width="14" height="18"> 
  (as in<em> think</em>), <strong>sh</strong>, <strong>wh</strong> and <strong>ch</strong>. 
  The vowel blends are <strong>ah, er, ow</strong>, <img src="images/words/oo.png" width="19" height="14">(as 
  in boot), <img src="images/words/oo-slur.png" width="19" height="15"> (as in<em> 
  foot</em>, except in Scotland) and <img src="images/words/air.png" width="19" height="16">. 
  The bar is understood to show the letter-name, <img src="images/words/a.png" width="10" height="14">, 
  <img src="images/words/e.png" width="10" height="14">, <img src="images/words/i.png" width="9" height="17">, 
  <img src="images/words/o.png" width="10" height="14"> and <img src="images/words/u.png" width="9" height="14">. 
  If MPC is used it is not necessary to know any other alternative sounds or blends, 
  like &#8216;oy&#8217; or &#8216;aw&#8217;, &#8216;igh&#8217; or &#8216;ai&#8217;. 
  These will follow later, but could be learnt by using substitutions over them 
  at first. Thus, if you decided to use MPC with slower Juniors and found they 
  already knew the usual simple phonic sounds, reference to the cue-card would 
  probably be all that was needed before they could begin decoding any marked 
  word for themselves. The cross indicating silent letters and the substitution 
  are quickly understood.<br>
  <br>
  Limitations to MPC&#8217;s use are found in some cases where a child&#8217;s 
  sight memory for words is so good that analysis seems unnecessary and rules 
  seem to be deduced automatically. There is then no need to interfere with a 
  natural reading ability. The use of MPC for some spelling analysis might be 
  useful in such cases, and would probably be enjoyed and quickly understood to 
  improve insight into language. The other limitation is when children have such 
  poor reasoning power that analysis only makes things seem more impossible and 
  does not sustain their interest. MPC works extremely well with fairly mature 
  children who can reason but who do not memorise easily. Teaching skills such 
  as selection of the right time and place, how long to stay on one thing and 
  what will keep up interest as well as reinforce what must be learnt, must be 
  exercised with MPC as with any other teaching aid.<br>
  <br>
  There are many useful aids for teaching phonics, such as those in <em>Phonics</em> 
  and the <em>Teaching of Reading</em> by J.M. Hughes (Evans Brothers, 1972), 
  and there is no need to repeat here what is readily available elsewhere. However, 
  the more complex forms, such as &#8216;ea&#8217;, &#8216;final e&#8217;, &#8216;-tion&#8217;, 
  can be left till later, and reading using MPC can be done without them. These 
  rules and exceptions could then be deduced in the course of reading in the same 
  way. It is hoped, as rules of grammar are absorbed in the course of learning 
  to speak. It is probable that better learning will take place if rules are pointed 
  out and reinforced, but this can be done once reading is already fluent using 
  MPC (see Chapter 4).</font></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Learning to blend sounds</strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other consideration 
  is blending, which is a problem in MPC just as it is in any other phonic work. 
  It is quite common to meet children who know the sounds and yet cannot put them 
  together. Many writers stress that to add a vowel to consonants, which is difficult 
  to avoid when trying to be heard across a classroom, creates unnecessary difficulty. 
  &#8216;Ber-a-ter&#8217; does not sound &#8216;bat&#8217; and this should be 
  remembered. One group with this fault was helped by the verses shown below. 
  These were put up on the wall in large print and we read them through until 
  they were known.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My d-a-d dad<br>
  Is s-a-d sad<br>
  For the pain in his tooth is so b-a-d bad.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some m-e-n men<br>

  And when it had chicks<br>
  They had t-e-n ten.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Young S-i-d Sid<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the s-u-n sun<br>
  With a g-u-n gun<br>
  Bill shot at a target<br>
  For f-u-n fun.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Children should, of course, learn 
  style and appreciation of literature once they been taught to read. This kind 
  of idea is used as a step on the way and more or less in desperation when confronted 
  with children who are hard to teach and difficult to interest.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Learning sounds in context</strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One cannot always 
  know enough about the experiences of such children to judge what has lead to 
  this kind of problem, or whether better methods would prevent it. However, it 
  is likely that learning sounds within words rather than in isolation, as suggested 
  earlier, would help. The method outlined here has proved very effective in achieving 
  this.<br>
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  The principle is to provide a simple, illustrated sentence within the child&#8217;s 
  interest and experience, which is read first. Two letters are picked out below 
  it. The teacher sounds these and points out where they occur in the sentence. 
  In order to emphasise meaning the child is then asked a relevant question, which 
  necessitates making some prediction or association. Below this are a number 
  of random repetitions of the two symbols, from which the child has to pick out 
  the letters and discriminate between them, with help if necessary. For example:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Figure 6</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/figure/Fig_6.png" width="418" height="243"></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this case the 
  teacher might use the following approach: &#8220; Do you know what those two 
  letters say? What words are they under? Read the sentence until you come to 
  the first one. What word is it? What does it begin with? That&#8217;s the sound 
  &#8216;m&#8217;. What word is that letter under? (dog) What sound does that 
  start with? (&#8216;d&#8217;) Now point to the &#8216;d&#8217; sounds underneath. 
  Point to a &#8216;m&#8217;, now a &#8216;d&#8217;.&#8221;<br>
  <br>
  Generally, the teacher should read the first sentence, or help the child to 
  do so, if he can, and then pint out hte soudns. After this preliminary work 
  the child can be left alone ot complete some follow-up activity, e.g. Colour 
  these pictures and write the letters under the pictures they belong to.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Figure 7</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/figure/Fig_7.png" width="447" height="196"></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <em>MPC Reading 
  Workbook</em> is based on thsis idea and provides pracitice in forming letters 
  as well as in recognising them. Follow-up activities designed to reinforce learning 
  are also suggested. Different sentences could of course be used according to 
  the age and ability of the children, while older slow-learners could use them 
  for individual work, with a tape.<br>
  <br>
  Blending can also be taught by pointing to sounds on a large cue-card and moving 
  about to make words, first of two letters, then of three, e.g. <em>at, in, up; 
  cat, win, pup</em>. Children may then try this individually or in pairs and 
  see how many words they can make, if possible in sentences.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other simple ideas 
  to give variety and aid memory are jingles like this which could be put on the 
  wall and illustrated. These contain all the MPC vowel sounds.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Relating MPC to an existing 
  reading scheme</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The use of cues can 
  be revised using flashcards based on your existing reading scheme. Write the 
  same word on both sides of a card, cueing one side only. Help children to learn 
  the words using cues, then to try to remember them without cues. The cards can 
  be held up for work with a group, or given to pairs or individual children. 
  Knowing the first hundred most common words is a great help in making a start, 
  since these form a large proportion of all reading matter. It is vital to go 
  through them with the children and show them how the cues are cued before they 
  can be left to do it themselves. Words with more than two syllables should not 
  be used, since these require a skill in breaking down words which should be 
  taught later.<br>
  <br>
  Once this decoding ability has been acquired it is possible for it to outstrip 
  understanding. This makes it even more essential that attention should be given 
  to general language, knowledge and experience of all kinds as well as to reading. 
  The teacher should encourage the use of dictionaries in which word meanings 
  are simply explained, and see that, even if children can read for themselves, 
  they are questioned about what they have read or allowed to discuss it, and 
  not just left to get on alone. Even when children become expert at word attack, 
  their reading matter needs to be graded for content difficultly and vocabulary. 
  It must be emphasised that no one stops learning to read. Even the most expert 
  can improve their speed, vocabulary, ability to skim, to find main points, to 
  summarise and evaluate, and so on. If children do make good progress in the 
  early skills, it is vital to build upon and continue this work, so that the 
  initial progress is not lost later.</font></p>

  <font size="7">4</font> <font size="5">How to withdraw the use of cues at the 
  right time and aid spelling</font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Minimal phonic cues 
  are intended only as a temporary aid to learning. It is therefore necessary 
  to consider how long they should be used and in what way they should be discarded. 
  Because there is no changeover to another script, the way in which the cues 
  are discarded depends largely on the way in which they have been used.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>An MPC reading 
  programme</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This example is based 
  on work which was tried in an Infant class of about thirty-five children with 
  a range of five to seven years. Though set out in the form of a progression, 
  individual children were at different points on the programme. Books were not 
  marked but new words were on cued lists.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Pre-reading work 
  to develop language, visual and aural discrimination, interest in stories, understanding 
  the use of labels to convey meaning, etc.<br>
  2. Using means such as wall-stories, captions on the children&#8217;s own pictures, 
  class news books, the breakthrough stand and materials (Long-man), to aid word 
  matching and sentence matching and to give the idea that print conveys meaning.<br>
  3. Writing begun, letter formation and learning of sounds.<br>
  4. Any other reading pursued intuitively by whole-word learning until at least 
  consonant sounds are known, when they should be used as guide in conjunction 
  with context clues. Phonic work as suggested in <a href="link">Chapter 3 (page 
  21).</a><br>
  5. After the sound concepts are well established, repetition and some drilling 
  on sound symbols for about five minutes daily until, with the cue-card as an 
  aid to memory, MPC can be used for decoding new words. Children given individual 
  cue-cards to learn and use. Large wall cue-card provided.<br>
  6. MPC then used in one or more of the ways suggested in <a href="link">Chapter 
  2</a>.<br>
  7. IF new words are marked on books, children can ignore any marks they don&#8217;t 
  need. Once a vocabulary of about 150 words is known, (usually by about the fourth 
  book of a reading scheme), work could begin on extracting the rules of spelling 
  and pronunciation using some system of word analysis. MPC dictionaries could 
  still be used, but group teaching using MPC Spelling Workbook will now speed 
  the process of internalising the sound-symbol relationships before children 
  go on to a Junior class.<br>
  In age-grouped classes the programme should be begun and proceed as far as possible, 
  with records kept on children&#8217;s progress so that it can be continued without 
  interruption according to individual needs. An ideal form for such records is 
  shown in Figure 8, using squared paper. The stages may be groups of sounds learnt, 
  books read or any graded set of skills. It is then easy to group children for 
  practice by lookng donw the record to see which are at the same stage.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To achieve the maximum 
  benefit this programme should be agreed and co-ordinated throughout an Infant 
  department. If some teachers wish to use MPC, while others do not, it should 
  be used only incidentally to aid understanding and not be relied on too heavily. 
  Partial use in this way is not confusing because no departure has been made 
  from normal spelling. No harm will be done if MPC is incompletely mastered by 
  the time of transfer to another school, provided that analysis was not over-emphasised 
  at a stage when it was only confusing rather than helpful to a child who could 
  have made some progress by whole word learning and use of context. Slow-learning 
  children are greatly helped in later &#8216;remedial&#8217; work (though this 
  is a misnomer for children properly taught) if they really know the sounds and 
  digraphs thoroughly, whether cues are to be used or not. If cues are used in 
  later teaching of slow-learners, a basic knowledge of the sounds as shown on 
  the cue-card will enable quick progress to be made once the child has attained 
  the mental maturity necessary for satisfactory analysis and synthesis. Independent 
  learning using cues will then also be helped.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Leaving cues 
  behind</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The transfer consists 
  of &#8216;internalising&#8217; the cues; knowing that an &#8216;e&#8217; at 
  the end of a word is not sounded, that &#8216;gh&#8217; is similar, but may 
  modify the preceding vowel, that &#8216;-tion&#8217; is sounded &#8216;shon&#8217;, 
  etc.; the things which good readers do unconsciously without cues. Cues aid 
  this normal process and, having made it more conscious, also help spelling.<br>
  The <a href="link"><em>MPC spelling Workbook</em></a> defines the main spelling 
  rules, using cues, and suggests children&#8217;s activities for each rule. In 
  this way, learning is reinforced. The book&#8217;s contents are briefly listed 
  below. Of course, these are all rules which have to be learnt whether MPC is 
  used or not. The progression is designed to ensure that children who have used 
  MPC in the early stages are finally able to discard it while getting as much 
  value as possible from it. Each page of the <a href="link"><em>MPC Spelling

  Alphabetical order, needed for looking up words and for listing things, is sometimes 
  neglected. See that children can recite the letters of the alphabet in order 
  at some point, and also give practice in thinking whether one letter comes before 
  another, to help in looking forward or back. Plenty of practice is needed in 
  various ways before children can use a dictionary quickly and, of course, small 
  wordbooks, followed by 500-word, 1000-word or 2000-word dictionaries may help 
  children to reach the stage of using a bigger one. The <em><a href="link">MPC 
  Word List</a></em> will be found very useful here. Exercises on finding a word 
  its second or third letter are also needed, e.g. <em>because, before, behind</em>.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Lesson 31</em><br>
  Check that all small letters and capital letters are known. For bright and average 
  children this should be so by the time they transfer from Infant to Junior classes. 
  Once children can read and write with reasonable fluency it is better for them 
  to use the letter-names for spellings. For the less-able this should be postponed 
  until they can read without needing to build up sounds aloud, or they will get 
  confused. Eventually, both will be known. If MPC has been used systematically, 
  capital letters which differ from lower-case will have been marked with substitutions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Nursery-reception, 4-5 years</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whatever the methods 
  or media used, the training and experience which the pupil brings to the task 
  will be a major factor in success. For example, in athletics a new style or 
  technique is likely to make a marginal improvement possible, but the athlete&#8217;s 
  enthusiasm and fitness, and the trainer&#8217;s skill are also very important. 
  The most important aspect of early teaching is concerned with the &#8216;fitness 
  of the athlete&#8217;. The skills of using spoken language freely and well, 
  being able to see and hear differences and similarities, and getting interested 
  in wanting to read are the most important things to attend to initially. There 
  is no need to repeat the information and help available in a number of other 
  books and courses, but it is important to attend to this aspect as well as to 
  choose materials which suit your purposes.<br>
  <br>
  Today, great stress is laid on the importance of early language skills in preparation 
  for reading, as well as on all-round development. Of course they are important, 
  and as much as possible should be done to teach them. However, it is possible 
  that children whose language background is poor are at an increased disadvantage 
  if they are expected to rely almost entirely on context cues in reading. One 
  way to tackle this problem is to increase the learner&#8217;s language skill, 
  but another approach is to make better use of other clues to words, so that 
  reasoning may come into play more fully. Activities to train visual skills will 
  possibly help children with poor visual discrimination and memory, but they 
  are likely to make more progress using other skills as well, such as hearing 
  and even touch and movement. All the senses should be given stimulus and practice 
  in the pre-school child, for a multi-sensory approach gives a far better chance 
  of success.<br>
  <br>
  Sound discrimination activities are vitally important if an aid like MPC is 
  going to be used, though they would also benefit children using other learning 
  methods. Picture-sorting, a common visual activity, is more useful if children 
  are helped to sort by the first letter sound, even before they know the symbol. 
  &#8216;I-spy&#8217; games, grouping things in scrapbooks according to first 
  letter sound or even vowel sound, calling out groups of children whose names 
  begin with the same sound, using music, rhythm and rhyme, all help to train 
  the ear. Children with mild speech defects may be helped by such activities 
  and should, of course, also receive whatever special help is available. Any 
  child who can speak must be able to hear sound in order to reproduce it&#8217; 
  he doesn&#8217;t ask for meat when he wants a sweet, though he may say &#8216;sleet&#8217; 
  or something near it. What has first been done unconsciously and intuitively 
  needs to become more conscious in preparation for using written symbols for 
  these sounds. Children are often unaware of separate words and may think of 
  phrases like &#8216;got-to-go&#8217; or &#8216;in-a-minute&#8217; as one unit. 
  To read and write they must break up the flow of speech. Activities with labels 
  and wall-stories, suggested in <a href="links">Chapter 2</a>, are valuable ways 
  of showing children word relationships, even before they may be expected to 
  remember the details. Younger children in the 5- to 7-year-old range can learn 
  from watching older ones matching words and letters, and start doing it themselves 
  when they are ready.</font></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Infant classes, 5-7 years</strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although MPC is a 
  system which concentrates on individual sounds, fifty to a hundred words should 
  be learnt as wholes before analysis by sounds is introduced. During this period 
  children should be learning to write and recognise individual sounds, but only 
  in readiness for later word-building. This age-range should start with sight-recognition 
  of words and phrases. Word-attack skills should be introduced when they already 
  have a basic sight vocabulary, since using individual sounds form the first 
  might lead to the habit of stopping to build up each word more than should be 
  necessary. An approach using the children&#8217;s own language should employ 
  the same principle.<br>
  <br>
  Since phonic work of one kind or another will inevitably be undertaken later, 
  whether formally or informally, the sound-symbol bonds must be thoroughly learnt. 
  What better time to learn these than while the letter-forms are being taught? 
  The MPC Reading Workbook is designed to do this, and provides individual practice 
  to consolidate learning. Informal ways of reaching the concepts of what sounds 
  do in words and sentences, what they are and how they can be used, are as vital, 
  at first, as learning number concepts before the use of their written forms. 
  Young children enjoy repetition, which is the natural way a baby learns to practise 
  vocal sounds. The same practice can be given, for a few minutes each day, using 
  a means such as the cue-card. It will be well repaid later in an increased facility 
  and freedom to decode new words. Some teachers think there is no place at all 
  for repeating something until it is thoroughly memorised. If all teaching were 
  of this kind they would have a case, but it is a mistake to ignore repetition 
  altogether. Once the MPC sounds are fairly well known children should have some 
  means of using them to help when they come to a new word in their reading, for 
  instance in one of the ways suggested in <a href="link">Chapter 2</a>. The cues 
  will also be used for looking up words in small, marked dictionaries or the 
  <a href="link"> <em>MPC Word List</em></a> to help with writing.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Once an average seven-year-old level of reading has been reached it may be time 
  to use cues for spelling rules and word study, rather than for reading, as explained 
  in <a href="link">Chapter 4</a>. All the other skills of reading &#8211; understanding 
  the main point of a story, using the context &#8211; and, of course, writing 
  all the attention, since enlarged experience in environmental work, stories 
  read aloud, art expression, music and so on, all help the child to gain a balance 
  of experience and enlarged vocabulary, as well as being valuable and interesting 
  in their own right. It is vital that decoding ability should not be allowed 
  to outstrip vocabulary and experience. Meanings of new words become very important, 
  leading to the use of dictionaries. The child may, through learning to read 
  quickly, begin all the sooner to &#8216;read to learn&#8217;. However, he should 
  not attempt reading matter beyond his understanding even if he can decipher 
  the words. There is a wide choice of fiction and information for this age level, 
  and it is a good time to consolidate and enjoy the fruits of learning to read, 
  while concentrating on mastering writing and spelling to some level of accuracy.<br>
  <br>
  For any children with such problems that they have not been able to reach an 
  average standard, a thorough recognition of phonic sounds and their symbols 
  will be invaluable in any remedial work. It is frightening to find such children, 
  after two or three years in school, having learnt only a few words by sight 
  recognition and very few sounds. Surely they could learn forty-five sound-symbol 
  bonds if enough time were given to it. They could then make rapid reading progress 
  using MPC. Numerous experiments have shown that learning the sounds and their 
  symbols is the only real barrier to progress. Once this has been done, the rest 
  is easy.<br>
  <br>
  In teaching the two MPC symbols, the cross and the substitution, it is important 
  to present them not as yet another thing to learn, but while explaining the 
  structure of a word. For instance, if a child comes to the word &#8216;beautiful&#8217; 
  the teacher would say something like this, putting in marks at the same time: 
  &#8220;We don&#8217;t sound the &#8216;e&#8217; or the &#8216;a&#8217; (putting 
  the cross over them) and the &#8216;u&#8217; (adding the bar) sounds its name. 
  Now can you put this part together? There are only two sounds &#8216;<img src="images/words/bu.png" width="18" height="14">&#8217;. 
  Can you get it? Try the rest of the word. (Substitute &#8216;<img src="images/words/oo-slur.png" width="19" height="15">' 
  above the second &#8216;u&#8217;.) Now start the sentence again.&#8221; The 
  child will then probably be able to read the word. If not, another approach 
  would be to get him to leave out the word and find what is being described, 
  then go back to &#8216;beautiful&#8217; and use a mixture of context nad phonic 
  cues to find out what it is.<br>
  <br>
  Children quickly understand how MPC can help, and find its logic attractive. 
  It is very hard on them, after being encouraged to use reason in thinking things 
  out and solving problems, to be presented with some thing as illogical as the 
  English spelling system. The fact that MPC gives a guide that can be trusted 
  in <em>every</em> case is really appreciated and a great morale-booster.<br>
  <br>
  It is vital that word-building in this way should be encouraged only once it 
  really is helpful, so that it does not become a burden, hindering the understanding 
  of what is written. In the early stages practice with sounds can be done in 
  an enjoyable activity or game <a href="link">(see Appendix 1)</a>, separate 
  from other reading, until the required maturity is reached.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Junior children, 7-11 years</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For many children 
  there is a change of school at 7-plus. Ideally, close contact between schools 
  would prevent any problems connected with the change from arising. If MPC was 
  used in an Infant department the children concerned should be allowed to continue 
  with it and stop using it when they are ready, at least with their reading. 
  The best results are achieved when a child has learnt the spelling rules using 
  MPC, so that it can be used for an understanding of word structure and spelling, 
  giving time for this to be internalised and the prop discarded. Children who 
  are moved from a school using MPC to a Junior school which does not use it are 
  at no disadvantage. Any learning of sounds is equally valid in MPC and t.o., 
  the children will not be used to writing in a different script, and they will 
  not have to change their print in reading.<br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, if a Junior teacher who likes MPC has children from an Infant 
  school which did not use it, there will be no difficultly in introducing it 
  where needed. The children should already know most of the phonic sounds, which 
  are the basis of MPC, and some revision of these with the introduction of the 
  two marks, the cross and the substitution, will allow its use. MPC shows sound-spelling 
  relationships clearly and so might at least be used when explaining something 
  involving this from the blackboard, or compiling lists of different ways of 
  spelling the same sound. Unfortunately, MPC is of no help in deciding whether 
  to use &#8216;their&#8217; or &#8216;there&#8217;, &#8216;-tion&#8217; or &#8216;-sion&#8217;, 
  &#8216;-ight&#8217; or &#8216;-ite&#8217; in writing, although it is a great 
  help in rading such sounds with the right pronunciation. A very interesting 
  and imaginative form of word study can, however, be undertaken using the <em>MPC 
  Spelling Workbook</em> as explained in <a href="link">Chapter 4</a>. The extent 
  to which this would be advisable depends on the children and their skills.<br>
  <br>
  An analogy can be made between learning the skills of literacy and finding your 
  way in a new town. If you have a good aural memory, instructions of the &#8216;first 
  left, second right&#8217; variety can be used. This is hopeless for those who 
  can&#8217;t remember what is said, but they may manage if the same instructions 
  are written down. Others, with good pictorial memory and understanding, may 
  do better looking at a street map. Some may use cues, like a pub on the corner 
  or an uphill slope or a shop. Even better, some may learn by being accompanied 
  a few times. However the process began, after a time one just knows the way, 
  forgetting how this knowledge was acquired. Similarly it is in the early stages 
  of teaching reading that method is important. After a time the skill comes naturally. 
  In most cases different ways of teaching achieve very similar results in the 
  end. The main difference will be found in the less-able learners, more of whom 
  are likely to fall by the wayside if the method doesn&#8217;t suit them or if 
  they have been discouraged.<br>
  <br>
  An experiment comparing scores in pre-reading activities with progress after 
  nine months at school showed that children could make reasonable progress if 
  they were strong in some areas, such as language structure, visual discrimination 
  or sound discrimination, even if they were weak in one of the other areas. Those 
  who were far behind were weak in almost all areas. It is unlikely that MPC can 
  do much for these children. They need to improve their powers of learning by 
  practising the kind of activities they should have done before starting school. 
  However, because MPC can use interesting material which is not graded in too 
  restrictive language, whole-word learning, use of context, sounds and reasoning 
  almost equal quantities, the chances of success are increased.<br>
  One warning should be given about MPC. It is usually hard to interest children 
  in conventional word analysis of the kind used in Tansley&#8217;s Sound Sense. 
  On the other hand, a teacher who recently used MPC for word analysis says the 
  children find it so enjoyable that they are inclined to do too much! This is 
  perhaps the only drawback to the scheme.</font></p>

  Some Juniors with below-average attainments are only just seven on transfer 
  and have not had as long in the Infant school as others. This is sometimes overlooked 
  in assessing them. A few of these will also have had considerable periods of 
  absence or have moved school several times. They need to receive extra attention 
  in following the usual programme so that any gaps in their skills and knowledge 
  may be filled, e.g. by teaching phonic sounds. Some may be slightly brain-damaged 
  and deficient in ability in one or more areas, often particularly in hand-eye 
  co-ordination or perception. For these, I would recommend training the weak 
  points and using the strong ones. Some have major or minor physical defects 
  which are not always diagnosed. For instance, if a child has one weak eye he 
  may be able to see and yet soon get tired of making the effort. Catarrh often 
  causes temporary deafness or partial loss of hearing. Examples of cultural deprivation 
  may range from the child who is well cared-for physically and emotionally, but 
  whose language is limited and interest in books small, to one from a shocking 
  home, who is maladjusted, insecure, antisocial, lacking in proper sleep, and 
  so on. In a few cases children have been poorly taught, often because a system 
  was adhered to which didn&#8217;t suit the particular child, or because there 
  was not enough systems. These children may have widely differing needs, different 
  capacities and potential, different strengths and weaknesses. No one idea will 
  work for all of them. The teacher must decide whether MPC is worth trying, either 
  with a group or an individual, and attention must be paid to many aspects other 
  than the methods used to teach reading.<br>
  <br>
  For one reason or another these children will have a small sight vocabulary 
  and lack skill in decoding new words. A good deal of remedial work is therefore 
  concerned with developing decoding skills, learning sounds and blends, and trying 
  to use them to attack new words. It is necessary to find books which practise 
  these skills, as well as books which are of Junior interest, but of Infant reading 
  standard. Although there are now many of these on the market, they are inclined 
  either to concentrate on interest, like the <em>Griffin and Pirate series</em> 
  (E. J. Arnold), or on phonics, like the <em>Royal Road Readers</em> (Chatto 
  &amp; Windus). The <em>Oxford Colour Readers</em> (O.U.P.) concentrate on picture 
  cues while the <em>Dr Seuss</em> books (Collins) combine comic-strip type humour 
  for phonics with humorous picture cues. Variety is important, so that the reading 
  material suits the child&#8217;s own needs and interests. This can be ensued 
  if the children make their own books by dictating them or drawing the pictures 
  for them.<br>
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Of course, MPC can be added to any book, kit, reading-card or homemade written 
  matter. Any of the ideas described previously to avoid marking the books could 
  be used, and any method of learning sounds. For children who take a long time 
  to memorise anything, learning and using the forty-five MPC sounds is much simpler 
  either than trying to remember many &#8216;sight&#8217; words or using standard 
  phonics, learning a large number of blends and groupings before the system &#8216;works&#8217;. 
  Moreover, the teacher has a much wider choice of materials with which to try 
  to arouse interest.<br>
  <br>
  If the class normally uses work-cards, harder words on them can quickly be marked 
  with MPC so that the poorer readers can decode them without feeling inferior. 
  The slow child is often ashamed of his poor ability and does not ask for help 
  when needed. MPC enables him to progress alone, giving him an independence highly 
  valued by most children. They also like having their own small cue-cards as 
  memory-aids. If slow children in a normal class can help themselves, more time 
  will be spent in reading, and their attitudes towards learning will be improved.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Secondary children needing 
  help</strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These children usually 
  understand and remember sounds and cues very quickly. MPC can then be used on 
  material suitable for their needs and interests. This might include reading 
  matter from newspapers or magazines, forms, labels, signs and all the &#8216;real-life&#8217; 
  written material they so badly need to read. It should be remembered that small 
  print is difficult to cue. One way round this problem is to print enlargements 
  and simplified texts to go with magazine pictures or sports news, mark them 
  with MPC and paste them in. It is less damaging to the self-respect of a backward 
  child of secondary age to be seen with an adult paper, even if he is reading 
  something pasted into it instead of the printed text, than to have an obviously 
  babyish book to read. If short, simple sentences and words mainly of one or 
  two syllables are used, material is less likely to be too difficult, and it 
  can still be varied and mature in content. Cued books are especially useful 
  here, enabling more varied reading to take place.<br>
  <br>
  In some secondary schools all pupils are given the same topic worksheets or 
  assignments, the remedial teachers preparing simplified versions for those who 
  need them. If the slower children know MPC the cues can be added to the worksheets 
  instead of rewriting the whole assignment. A secondary teacher who tried MPC 
  with her less-able children reported that they learnt it &#8216;almost at once&#8217; 
  and that it worked &#8216;like magic&#8217;.<br>
  <br>
  When children are being taught by a variety of teachers in a number of different 
  curriculum areas it has to be recognised that reading progress in each subject 
  is the responsibility of all teachers. It cannot be confined to one or two special 
  teachers. Even English language teachers have to teach the appreciation of literature 
  and improved style in written work with the majority, and so find it hard to 
  help a few with basic skills at the same time. As with Juniors, MPC allows more 
  working without help once marks have been added to the words likely to cause 
  trouble. Books printed with cues would probably be most useful with older children, 
  because they would benefit from longer passages and a greater variety of vocabulary 
  which it would be time-consuming to mark by hand. Some bright children might 
  be able to add cues accurately, thus aiding their own spelling and analysis 
  of word structure. These books could be used for slower ones. Since larger print 
  than usual may be needed for cues to be clear, marked bookmarks or a marked 
  dictionary of harder words at the back of a book might be more practical. A 
  tape of the cue-card which could be borrowed and run through by a child who 
  was well-motivated to learn would make progress possible and require very little 
  extra teacher time. A teacher who tried MPC with some severely retarded readers 
  of 12-13 told me that it took only few minutes to explain the system. If a child 
  was stuck with a word, pencilling cues over it enabled him to read it immediately. 
  A cued dictionary, such as the MPC Word List, would have enabled him to look 
  a word up and then read it. The small amount of initial instruction needed to 
  teach MPC and so enable backward secondary children to learn for themselves 
  is a clear advantage.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Adult illiterates</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although this title 
  is commonly used, my own experience of two years&#8217; evening-class teaching 
  of basic literacy has shown me what a variety of needs it can cover. I originally 
  took on the work intending to experiment with the use of MPC with these students. 
  Although I used some aspect of it with most of them, either for reading or spelling, 
  it was a spectacular success with only a small proportion. I had to abandon 
  any idea of carrying out a set programme of learning sounds and cues together 
  and then using them with all pupils, because it was obviously not in their best 
  interests.<br>
  <br>
  Of weaker ones, with a reading age of 6-7 years, the majority knew the alphabet 
  letter-names and seemed to think learning phonic sounds was babyish in some 
  way. As they were so insecure and likely to stop coming at the slightest setback 
  I could not tell them that the letter-names were practically useless and they 
  should learn something else. I therefore tried another tactic of getting them 
  to deduce sound from the letter-names, which some seemed able to do, and continued 
  telling them whole words and trying to increase sight vocabulary. MPC, introduced 
  as a spelling activity, was not viewed as so childish. One very successful idea 
  was to tape a radio programme likely to interest most of them, such as a report 
  on food prices or a sports commentary, play it to them and at the same time 
  write up words that occurred in it on a board. We then used it for discussion 
  to help them talk and think about it. Next I would see if they could read the 
  words I had put up. Usually one or two knew each word, so I used cues to point 
  out the sounds and how letters formed the phonic sound of he word, with some 
  of them unsounded others digraphs, etc. this worked very well and those who 
  could not read the words at first soon learnt to do so after a few tries.<br>
  <br>
  In this case, a number of students were West Indians, who had been taught at 
  school by learning letter-names first. This would be less likely to occur with 
  those who had attended British schools. However, I found that some of these 
  pupils had not &#8216;missed out&#8217; on education in the popular sense, but 
  were brain-damaged or handicapped in various ways. Some had been to E.S.N schools 
  where they had been well taught to have achieved what they had done so far, 
  and also given the desire to learn more. These usually know most of the phonic 
  sounds and only needed some revision of digraphs to begin using MPC providing 
  they had the necessary reasoning power. On the other hand, a small proportion 
  were intelligent people who had long spells in hospital as children, where either 
  no teaching was given or they were too ill to take it. Several had taught themselves 
  to read but were worried about their spelling. Some had never learnt the alphabet 
  order so that they could use a dictionary, and really only needed that in order 
  to help themselves. MPC may thus certainly be useful with adults, but must be 
  applied with discretion according to need. <br>
  <br>
  The best approach with very poor adult readers is to aim at the recognition 
  of the hundred most common sight-words, while at the same time working on word-attack 
  skills with the <em>MPC Spelling Workbook</em>. A reading scheme using MPC might 
  well be useful in some cases, using adult material. It would have the great 
  advantages of providing phonic practice on normal adult vocabulary, and giving 
  practice in seeing the relationship of sound and spelling in the course of reading 
  interesting material in context. Once sounds are learnt, any marked books can 
  be used.<br>
  <br>
  I tried making reading cards on which a piece from a newspaper was pasted and 
  printed out in large type below, with cues added. Pupils could take a card home 
  and practise on the cued script, then try reading the cutting on its own. Another 
  idea, explained in <a href="link">Chapter 3</a>, was to help a pupil to make 
  his own book about his job or family, or about cars or some other interest. 
  Word matching and word analysis using cues was practised on each bit as it was 
  written. Wall labels and comic strip pictures with captions were also used with 
  the virtual non-readers in the way advocated with Infants <a href="link">(see 
  page 22)</a>, but made more relevant to their interests. Whereas schoolchildren 
  are a captive audience, it is important to keep adults coming happily, and other 
  considerations must sometimes be sacrificed to this one. They thought a great 
  deal of these books they had made themselves, in some cases never having expressed 
  themselves in writing before. One man who started a little story about his childhood 
  kept reading a few lines over and over to himself with a sort of creative pride 
  which was quite touching. A woman who had not been able to write to her son 
  abroad wept over the first letter she managed to get down on paper with a good 
  deal of help. Another pupil, who had learnt to read in English in school in 
  Pakistan, could read even irregular words like &#8216;neighbour&#8217; without 
  difficulty, yet hardly understood any word meanings. If anyone ever &#8216;barked 
  at print&#8217; he did. Speaking and extending his English vocabulary were his 
  first needs. He learnt very quickly, using children&#8217;s picture dictionaries 
  at first, and was soon persuaded not to be satisfied with reading unless he 
  understood it.<br>
  <br>
  Since this is not a book on teaching adults these matters are only touched on 
  to show how important it is to be sensitive to the needs of one&#8217;s pupils. 
  Although I think a knowledge of MPC may well add to the tutor&#8217;s range 
  of skills and resources, it must only be used where useful and not be expected 
  to meet all needs. The older the pupil, the wider the variety becomes. When 
  teaching adults on a one-to-one basis, simply pencilling MPC over words on which 
  people get stuck is very useful. It helps the pupil to see the sound-spelling 
  correspondence and is a reminder if he reads it again to himself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><br>
  Overseas students learning to read English</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This category also 
  covers a wide range of needs. At present I can only suggest in what ways MPC 
  might prove useful.<br>
  <br>
  It is likely that it would be a very good method for intelligent English speakers 
  who have never before learnt to read or write the language. They would learn 
  the sounds and cues very quickly and then, if given cued reading books, could 
  teach themselves a great deal and learn with very little help. This would be 
  a great advantage where resources were limited and very formal teaching methods 
  necessary. A short spell of direct formal teaching would quickly be followed 
  by independent reading. Another great advantage is that the basic sounds could 
  be taught with an English accent and then applied to words. The <em>MPC Spelling 
  Workbook</em> would be very useful in doing this. The main problem would probably 
  be that although such pupils speak English it is really their second language 
  and that therefore their reading technique might soon outstrip their vocabulary. 
  However, if less time were needed for learning the mechanics of reading more 
  time could be given to extending experience and vocabulary in various ways.<br>
  <br>
  English has an advantage over some languages in having such things as invariable 
  adjectives and relatively simple declensions. However, word meanings such as 
  &#8216;go on, go off, go away, go to, go after, go with&#8217; give trouble 
  because they are so varied. Irregular spelling is another source of difficulty. 
  The use of MPC in such cases would be very much a matter for the teacher&#8217;s 
  discretion. It would be quite permissible, for instance, to point out the number 
  of unsounded letters by using the cross over them when giving explanations, 
  or to use the bar and slur in the same way to show pronunciation where needed, 
  without using the full system. One or two teachers who tried MPC stated that 
  some of it seemed unnecessary with their pupils but they had used some aspect 
  of it where they found it useful. This is fine and must be emphasised as one 
  of the advantages of the system. It can and should be used and adapted in any 
  way required. The teacher is the best judge of what her pupils need, and has 
  no need to feel guilty if using MPC in a different way from one that has been 
  advocated, provided it works. For instance, one person who tried it said that 
  the cue-card had several things on it which the children didn&#8217;t understand, 
  e.g. they didn&#8217;t know what an acorn was. The obvious thing to do would 
  be to alter this picture to &#8216;ape&#8217; or &#8216;ace&#8217; or anything 
  the pupils did know. Similarly, objects have different names in different places, 
  e.g. a van may be called a truck; there may be no thistles or roses or owls. 
  So you alter it to something else. There is nothing sacrosanct about the pictures 
  which are used to aid sound recognition, though the sounds themselves should 
  remain largely the same, as they have been carefully considered. Deviation from 
  them might be necessary if, for instance, teaching in a Scottish accent, where 
  &#8216;bot&#8217; and &#8216;foot&#8217; have the same vowel sound. There may 
  be no need then to use the two forms on the cue-card. Some may feel that the 
  sound &#8216;ear&#8217; should be included on the cue-card, and should therefore 
  add it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Students of language structure</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is becoming increasingly 
  common to include the study of language structure in various courses on language 
  and communication. The <a href="link">International Phonetic Alphabet </a>is 
  a rather complicated designation of the English sound system. Some symbols, 
  being unlike English forms, need some practice in learning and can easily be 
  misinterpreted when used for just one or two lectures. MPC provides a simple 
  and reliable alternative which is readily understood by the non-specialist.<br>

  <font size="7">6</font> <font size="5">Conclusion</font></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The aim of this book 
  has been to explain a new but very simple idea in such a way that anyone interested 
  will have no difficulty in understanding and using it. Judging by the large 
  number of teachers who have been able to experiment with MPC after reading only 
  two or three pages of information and ideas, it has shown itself to be readily 
  understood. It is to be hoped that the extra information and suggestions included 
  here will make it easier for those who are less enterprising or experienced, 
  and also benefit the pioneers by sharing the many ideas which have been found 
  successful in one way or another.<br>
  <br>
  One of the members of the Bullock Committee, whose Report has been published 
  since most of the experimental work was done on MPC, encourage me to make this 
  work available to teachers as worthwhile aid. The following relevant recommendations 
  are made in the Bullock Report.<br>
  <br>
  &#8217;56. There is no one method, medium, approach, device or philosophy that 
  holds the key to the process of learning to read.&#8217;<br>
  <br>
  I should like to emphasise that I agree wholeheartedly with this statement. 
  MPC is an aid, not a panacea.<br>
  <br>
  &#8217;60. The accurate perception of individual letters and groups of letters 
  is an important factor in learning to read. Young children should be helped 
  to learn the characteristics of letters through a variety of games and activities, 
  not through formal exercises.&#8217;<br>
  <br>
  From the Report&#8217;s 333 recommendations I have selected those which give 
  most support to an aid like MPC. I agree with all the rest and would work on 
  language, encourage pre-reading skills, use &#8216;cloze&#8217; or practise 
  the use of context cues, teach for a variety of comprehension skills and so 
  on. It is in the area of learning the sound-symbol relationships that MPC is 
  most likely to help. The release from drills and from detailed phonic work detached 
  from the normal reading context should allow more meaningful reading and reduce 
  frustration and discouragement. Moreover, it enables pupils to do more for themselves, 
  which could make all the difference between wasting time waiting for attention 
  and getting on with the job of learning. Class organisation is simplified not 
  only because the children can work alone more easily but also because they can 
  start.<br>
  <br>
  It is often claimed that reading improvement resulting from intensive help out 
  of the classroom is not maintained on return. MPC allows slower children to 
  cope with work in the classroom and carry on more normally, once they know the 
  sounds, thus preventing any such loss.<br>
  <br>
  There is a fairly wide consensus of opinion today that teachers who have expected 
  their pupils to &#8216;pick things up&#8217; just because the opportunity is 
  there have been over-optimistic. There could easily be a corresponding swing 
  towards more formal methods of teaching which, in fact, the majority have never 
  abandoned. MPC strikes a good balance here. Although there is a very clear sound-symbol 
  structure for which some direct teaching is needed, MPC very quickly leads to 
  more freedom, both in learning independently with the motivation of success 
  and interest and in using almost any reading materials within the range of oral 
  understanding. Freedom from the restrictions of constant repetition for &#8216;look-say&#8217; 
  word learning as well as from the grading of phonic readers, starting with regular 
  three-letter words, allows for much more natural and easy writing.<br>
  <br>
  Finally, perhaps the most vital consideration is the need for co-operation between 
  home and school. The child with someone who can hear him read at home and who 
  can understand and share in the aims of the school will have a great advantage 
  over the child who is entirely dependent on what is learnt on the school premises. 
  Although everyday written language is not marked with cues, it is not in a different 
  script. The technique required to teach the MPC marks need not be sophisticated. 
  Any parent with a copy of the cue-card could do some good by going through it 
  to help the child learn the sounds. The majority of parents who have spent a 
  short time studying MPC could easily use cues to regularise a word in a newspaper 
  or book in order to help a child read it. Beyond the classroom, it is also ideal 
  for amateur volunteers helping in adult literacy campaigns. <br>
  <br>
  No other aid that I know of is so easy to learn and use. There is so little 
  to add to what is normally known and understood, yet it can make a spectacular 
  difference to the ease of reading and teaching to read. If MPC can help even 
  a few unhappy strugglers, something will have been achieved.<br>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On a piece of card 
  about 40 x 50 cm draw a road on which are marked about 50 moves between Start 
  and Home. Number six small containers (such as margarine tubs) 1 to 6. In turn, 
  the children throw a die and take a word from the tub of that number. When they 
  have read the word correctly they move that number of spaces. The first to reach 
  Home is the winner. To add interest the board can be made into a football game, 
  race track, treasure hunt, etc. Hazards can be added, e.g. Think squares: a 
  tub labelled Think contains cars saying &#8216;Think of three words beginning 
  with p&#8217;, &#8216;Think of four words ending with t&#8217;, etc. These are 
  read by the teacher.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The </strong><em>MPC 
  Workbooks, Word List</em><strong> and Checklists</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <em><a href="link">MPC 
  Teacher&#8217;s Book</a></em> is accompanied by two workbooks and a simple dictionary, 
  all for use by the pupil. Although mainly intended as part of a series making 
  full use of MPC as an aid to reading, they could easily be used with more traditional 
  methods. Only the normal alphabetical forms are used and all the letters are 
  included.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <a href="link"><em>MPC 
  Reading Workbook</em></a> teaches the main phonic sounds and how to form the 
  letters from which they are made. It does not go through them in alphabetical 
  order, but starts with the consonants which are most useful both as an aid to 
  recognising words and in teaching the correct movements. There is one representation 
  of each of the main sounds, e.g. <strong>ow</strong> but not<strong> ou</strong>. 
  The sounds <strong>ch</strong>, <strong>sh</strong>, <strong>ng</strong>, etc. 
  are included since these are regular in use. Children should become familiar 
  with them at an early stage, and think of them as sounds in their own right. 
  All the letters are used.<br>
  <br>
  Each page forms a complete unit, taking a its starting point and focus a simple, 
  lively illustration. Some direction and help are needed from the teacher, firstly 
  in reading the sentence and then in discussing it with the pupils to encourage 
  language and ensure that print is always associated with meaning and interest. 
  The <em>sound </em>of the letters is then pointed out and its association with 
  the symbol emphasised. The letter-names should not be taught at this stage. 
  The teacher should supervise the pupil&#8217;s writing movements before leaving 
  him to work alone, since this will avoid much trouble later. At the bottom of 
  each page are suggestions for further, more open-ended activities designed to 
  reinforce learning.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The<em> <a href="link">MPC 
  Spelling Workbook</a></em> teaches the main rules and exceptions of English 
  spelling, clearly shown with the help of MPC. Each rule is presented with examples 
  and practical reinforcement in the form of activities, so that the pupil learns 
  to spell through experience. A vocabulary of about 150 words is necessary before 
  beginning this workbook.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <em><a href="link">MPC 
  Word List</a></em> is a simple dictionary containing over 600 of the words most 
  commonly used in early reading with cues. Space is provided for the pupil to 
  add new words. Once pupils know the sounds and cues, they will be able to read 
  and learn the words and so recognise them in their books. It is hoped that this 
  will help to deal with the two great problems encountered by those teaching 
  reading to beginners: hearing pupils and giving them words for writing. By allowing 
  the pupils greater independence, the <em>MPC Word List</em> will save the teacher 
  time while laying the foundations for a thorough linguistic understanding of 
  phonemegrapheme correspondence.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>MPC Checklists</em>, 
  found on the last page of each book.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <a href="link"><em>MPC 
  Reading workbook</em></a> checklist lists the sounds covered in the book and 
  provides space to record the pupil&#8217;s progress: <em>knows sound</em> with 
  <em>picture cue</em>; <em>know sound without picture cue</em>. There is also 
  space for fuller notes on each sound.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <a href="link"><em>MPC 
  Spelling Workbook</em></a> checklist list the rules or skills covered in the 
  book, indexed by lesson number. It can thus also be used as a list of contents. 
  Since the workbook deals with the understanding of English spelling in principle, 
  rather than with learning actual examples of words, the checklist is designed 
  to record that each page has been worked through and understood. The pupil may 
  have to do a page more than once, so it is suggested that three marks be used 
  to show his progress: mark <img src="images/figure/tick_end.png" width="20" height="20" align="absbottom">doing 
  this page, tick<img src="images/figure/tick.png" width="20" height="20" align="absbottom"> 
  page completed with understanding, <img src="images/figure/cross.png" width="20" height="20" align="absbottom"> 
  success in later revision test. Understanding of the <em>MPC Spelling Workbook</em> 
  can also be tested using the quiz on page 55. This can be done as a game by 
  the pupils or used as a method of testing by the teacher.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <em>MPC Word 
  List</em> checklist is intended as a record of progress in using sounds and 
  cues. There are six columns: <em>First Sounds, Second Sounds, Blends, Simple 
  Words, Using Cues, Syllables and Endings</em>. At the head of each column is 
  a star which should be coloured in when the work in that column is complete. 
  The teacher could have a master copy of the checklist column is complete. The 
  teacher could have a master copy of the checklist with the same headings but 
  with the pupil&#8217; names some the side. The stars could then be entered against 
  the names, so helping to group the pupils.<br>
