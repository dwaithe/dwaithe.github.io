            <p class="MPCtitle">Background</p>
            <p class="MPCtext">Margaret Sanders, formerly a Senior Lecturer in the Education Department of Wolverhampton Polytechnic, first devised the MPC reading system in the early 1970s.

            <p class="MPCtext">Initially, 
              the MPC system was tried on a small scale, with about ten groups of 
              students of varying ages. The 
              experiments proved highly successful and Mrs Sanders published several 
              articles about her new scheme in the educational Press. These resulted 
              in widespread interest. By 1975 MPC had been tested successfully 
              in a large number of schools both in the UK and overseas. </p>
               
            <p class="MPCtext">In 
              January 1976 a questionnaire was sent to a cross-section of those 
              teachers who were using the scheme. It was their positive and enthusiastic 
              responses which prompted Mrs Sanders to consider publishing her 
              scheme as a complete teaching system. </p>

                  <p class="MPCtitle">What this website has to offer</p>

                  <p class="MPCtext">This 

                    website has been designed to be a complete resource for the 

                    learning and application of MPC for the teacher and the individual. 

                    Within this site is contained the complete <a href="arasa.htm">Teacher's 

                    Book</a> which provides a total course in the development 

                    and application of MPC. In addition, the <a href="resources.htm">resources</a> 

                    section contains the previously published MPC Reading and 

                    Spelling Workbooks, the MPC Word List, and plenty of back-up 

                    material including reading books, flashcards, and interactive 

                    activities to assist in the teaching and learning of MPC. 

                    All resources are readily downloadable at no-charge. It is 

                    advised that users first read the introduction to MPC, situated 

                    below, and then proceed to the <a href="resources.htm">resources</a> 

                    section to familiarize with the content of MPC.

                  <p class="MPCtitle">Introduction to MPC</p>

                  

                  <p class ="MPCtext">The principles of MPC are so simple that 

                    students soon learn to recognise and apply them. Once the 

                    theory has been grasped, success follows instantly.
                 MPC 

                    is based entirely on normal English spelling and can be used 

                    to regularise any word. Each of the 45 main phonic sounds 

                    is carefully defined, in letters and pictures, on a basic 

                    <a href="interactive.htm">Cue Card</a> (see right pane). Easy-to-recognise 

                    symbols placed over letters indicate correct pronunciation 

                    and a cross indicates silent letters (see below example). 

                    When there is no appropriate symbol, straightforward substitution 

                    is used. Any word can be successfully &#8216;decoded&#8217;, 

                    even if the spelling is confusing</font></p>

                  <p class="MPCtext" align="left"><strong>Fig: Example of text with symbols to indicate pronunciation.</strong></p>

                  <p class="MPCtext">MPC 

                    is especially suitable for adults who have problems with reading. 

                    This is because MPC does not rely on any new letter forms, 

                    so it can be applied to any existing reading matter. For this 

                    reason the scheme is also particularly helpful for students 

                    who need to improve their spelling, as words remain consistent 

                    throughout. Due to the flexibility of the system regional 

                    differences can also be easily encompassed. Detailed notes 

                    as to how to adapt the system to suit regional differences 

                    in pronunciation, for helping with spelling and the modification 

                    of the system for adults are included in the <a href="arasa.htm">Teacher&#8217;s 

                    Book</a>. </font></p>

                  <p class="MPCtext">One 

                    of the most frequent problems faced by teachers, working with 

                    both children and adults, is a lack of interest or boredom 

                    at the early learning stages. MPC is designed to overcome 

                    this difficultly. Firstly, because of the element of instant 

                    success, and secondly by providing a variety of suggestions 

                    for games, activities and other teaching aids to help stimulate 

                    and retain the students&#8217; interest. The scheme is a great 

                    benefit to busy teachers working with large classes.</p>
