            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Minimal 

              Phonic Cues</strong> aims to provide an accurate means of representing 

              the written word and its pronunciation at the same time. Many attempts 

              have been made to do this, since spelling irregularities cause so 

              much extra trouble to those learning to read English. The names 

              of the letters have never been a great deal of help and nearly all 

              teachers now use phonic sounds. The problem is that although simple 

              sounds help in decoding many words, there are still difficulties 

              with sounds made from two letters, like &#8216;ch&#8217; and even 

              more with the combinations like &#8216;igh&#8217; and &#8216;tion&#8217;, 

              and with the variable vowels such as the letter &#8216;a&#8217; 

              in <em>hat, make, call calm, paw, pail</em> and so on.</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">George 
              Bernard Shaw tried to persuade us to adopt a new, simplified alphabet. 
              As he said, you might say the imaginary word &#8216;ghoti&#8217; 
              spells &#8216;fish&#8217;-&#8216;gh&#8217; as in<em> tough</em>, 
              &#8216;o&#8217; as in <em>women</em>, and &#8216;ti&#8217; as in 
              <em>action</em>. More recently the initial teaching alphabet (i.t.a) 
              was devised. This includes most of the lower-case English letters, 
              together with a large number of new forms. While apparently giving 
              help to many children and teachers, the great i.t.a. experiment 
              has been criticised for the need to change to a slightly different 
              script later and for not starting with normal English spelling. 
              Various other ideas have been tried, including colour codes and 
              diacritical marks over letters. In all these quite a lot has to 
              be learnt before the system can be fully used, and no system gives 
              a guide which is reliable for every word.</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MPC, 

              on the other hand, gives a reliable guide to every single word. 

              It is not dependent on colour, it does not interfere with normal 

              print and it is extremely simple and easy to use. There is no single, 

              prescribed way of applying the scheme. Its use is determined by 

              the methods of the teacher and the needs of the children. This flexibility 

              is one of its greatest advantages, allowing MPC to be effectively 

              used with a wide variety of ages and situations.<br>

              with spelling irregularities<br>

              </strong></font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MPC starts 
              by analysing all the main English sounds and providing one symbol 
              for each, without using any new letter-shapes (see Figure 1). Although 
              both &#8216;c&#8217; and &#8216;x&#8217; can be represented by &#8216;k&#8217; 
              and &#8216;s&#8217;, and so are not really needed, they are included 
              so that the whole alphabet is shown. Double letters (or digraphs) 
              like &#8216;sh&#8217; and &#8216;ng&#8217; are linked by a slur 
              e.g. &#8216;<img src="images/words/sh.png" width="17" height="16"> 
              &#8217;, &#8216;<img src="images/words/ng.png" width="18" height="18" align="absbottom">&#8217;. 
              The &#8216;hard&#8217; vowel sounds are shown by a bar over the 
              top e.g. &#8216;<img src="images/words/a.png" width="10" height="14">&#8217;, 
              &#8216;<img src="images/words/e.png" width="10" height="14" align="bottom">&#8217;. 
              The sound &#8216; <img src="images/words/air.png" width="19" height="16">&#8217; 
              has been included, because there is only one &#8216;r&#8217; sound. 
              The &#8216;si&#8217;, as in television, could be shown by &#8216;zy&#8217; 
              above it. The &#8216;cue-card&#8217; below gives a picture as a 
              guide or mnemonic for each of the forty-five sounds. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Figure 1</strong></font></p>

            <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/Cue%20card/cue-card.png" width="483" height="418"> 

              </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

              Once these basic sounds and symbols can be recognised and the skill 

              of blending into words is acquired, there are only two other small 

              signs to learn. Any English word can be decoded without difficulty. 

              A cross is placed over silent letters, and a subsitution sound over 

              any which cannot be regularised otherwise, e.g. &#8216;<img src="images/words/come.png" width="40" height="17">&#8217;. 

              Though so simple, this works for<em> every</em> word.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

              The only other question is how to teach capitals. Many of them can 

              be recognised by their similarity to the lower-case letters, and 

              a substitution can be used to deal with the others, as in &#8216;<img src="images/words/cue%20card.png" width="54" height="21" align="baseline">&#8217;.</font><br>

              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="#top"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">back

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dialect may cause some 

              problems, mainly with the pronunciation of &#8216;a&#8217; but MPC&#8217;s 

              flexibility can allow for this.</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              Teachers in some places, for example, Scotland, may find that some 
              of the vowels are marked in a way which does not correspond to Scottish 
              children&#8217;s pronunciation. The &#8216;oo&#8217; sound, for 
              example in the word &#8216;good&#8217;, is more like &#8216;<img src="images/words/u.png" width="9" height="14">&#8217; 
              in Southern English and &#8216;you&#8217; is also pronounced differently. 
              The sounds &#8216;ur&#8217;, &#8216;or&#8217;, &#8216;au&#8217; 
              and &#8216;o&#8217; may also cause some difficulty, probably because 
              the &#8216;r&#8217; is sounded so much more strongly in Scottish 
              accents. Where such teachers are adapting MPC to suit their own 
              needs, as advised here, they should use whatever parts of the scheme 
              are helpful and modify those which are not. A slightly different 
              cue-card, omitting a sound like &#8216;<img src="images/words/er.png" width="16" height="15">&#8217; 
              and perhaps altering &#8216;<img src="images/words/oo.png" width="19" height="14">&#8217; 
              and &#8216;<img src="images/words/oo-slur.png" width="19" height="15">&#8217;, 
              might thus be appropriate. When words are being marked in books, 
              MPC can be used to make them sound as similar to the normal pronunciation 
              as possible. </font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              The main difference found in other English accents is between &#8216;a&#8217; 
              and &#8216;ah&#8217; in words like <em>dance</em>, <em>park</em> 
              and <em>ask</em>. Here the teacher should omit &#8216;ah&#8217; 
              from the cue-card if it is never used and, of course leave the &#8216;a&#8217; 
              uncued in words like <em>dance</em>. In the south one would cue 
              &#8216;<img src="images/words/park.png" width="32" height="25" align="absbottom">&#8217; 
              and &#8216;<img src="images/words/fast.png" width="28" height="22" align="bottom">&#8217; 
              and soon on if this were found to help reading. No change in cues 
              is necessary for other vowel forms, for example, if a Cockney child 
              sounds &#8216;nice&#8217; as &#8216;noice&#8217; because the child&#8217;s 
              response to &#8216;<img src="images/words/i.png" width="9" height="17">&#8217; 
              will always be read like &#8216;<img src="images/words/oi.png" width="13" height="18">&#8217;, 
              as it would be in normal script. Similarly, in the Midlands the 
              common pronunciation of &#8216;but&#8217; is more like the Southern 
              &#8216;<img src="images/words/boot.png" width="32" height="15">&#8217;. 
              It need not be cued, however, because the response to &#8216;u&#8217; 
              will always be &#8216;<img src="images/words/oo-slur.png" width="19" height="15">&#8217;. 
              The same applies to &#8216;mother&#8217; which could be cued either 
              as &#8216;<img src="images/words/mother_1.png" width="51" height="17">&#8217; 
              or &#8216;<img src="images/words/mother_2.png" width="51" height="20">&#8217; 
              if necessary.</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

              Today accents are usually left alone so long as speech is clear 

              and understandable. The influences of radio and television mean 

              that extremes of accent making a person from say, Devon unintelligible 

              in Yorkshire are rare. However if a child could only communicate 

              with local people he would be at a disadvantage for educational 

              purposes. However musical and interesting such an accent might be, 

              the case for preserving it intact is not strong. Many children learn 

              one accent for school and another for home. </font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

              MPC can help to define the sounds to be considered in any informed 

              discussion of accent, though it provides no absolute pronunciation 

              for them as does the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">International 

              Phonetic Alphabet</a> (IPA). This is thus a better system for dealing 

              with details of accent.</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

              Of a number of teachers who tried MPC throughout the British Isles 

              very few reported any snags. The main comments were from Scotland, 

              as outlined above. If there were too many difficulties of accent 

              you might decide that MPC was inappropriate for your pupils. However, 

              the flexibility of the system means that it can easily be adapted 

              to suit individual requirements, or used only in part. MPC is above 

              all, a practical aid, designed to be of the maximum possible use 

              with the minimum amount of detail. Any cue can be used, so long 

              as it enables the child to make a better attempt at recognising 

              the word and pronouncing it in the way which is natural to him (Unless 

              his normal speech is very defective).<br>

              MPC&#8217;s most useful features is the way in which it deals with 

              combinations of two vowel symbols which can be sounded in various 

              ways. Usually one of the letters represents the right sound in either 

              its phonic or letter-name form. A cross or a mark and, occasionally, 

              a substitution regularise all cases.</font></p>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several 

              points can be dealt with using Figure 5.<br>

              1. Although this example is fully and logically cued throughout 

              it is unlikely that any reader would need &#8216;the&#8217; cued 

              every time. Too many marks look confusing. However, if it <em>is</em> 

              thought necessary to use cues on every word they should be faintly 

              marked, so that they can be used if needed but ignored if not.<br>

              <br>

              2. The cross which shows a letter is unsounded has been put over 

              one of the repeated letters in &#8216;hill&#8217; and &#8216;hurried&#8217;. 

              Some teachers consider that this is unnecessary, as it probably 

              is for word recognition. However, since using single instead of 

              double letters is a common spelling fault, it is worth using the 

              cross to help children remember which words contain double letters. 

              It is also useful sometimes when marking passages for word study.<br>

              <br>

              3. The cross for unsounded letters is also used to deal with the 

              sound &#8216;schwa&#8217; in the International Phonetic Alphabet. 

              It cannot be designated using normal letter symbols, on which MPC 

              is based, except possibly by &#8216;uh&#8217;. It occurs with several 

              vowel spellings, but is more or less the same sound in <em>children</em>, 

              <em>to</em>, <em>the</em>, <em>correct</em>, <em>majestic</em> and 

              <em>succeed</em>, for example. The sounds &#8216;o&#8217;, &#8216;a&#8217; 

              and &#8216;u&#8217; in <em>correct</em>, <em>majestic</em> and <em>succeed</em> 

              do not really need to be cued because they are recognisable when 

              the word is pronounced slowly and carefully and only change to &#8216;uh&#8217; 

              at speed. Because the sounds &#8216;e&#8217; in <em>the</em> and 

              &#8216;o&#8217; in <em>to</em> are not like those in pen and <em>top</em>, 

              they logically need cues (though these are among the first words 

              to be learnt and should not need making for long, if at all). If 

              consistency is necessary for word study the required effect will 

              be achieved by putting a cross above the letter which is not to 

              be sounded. &#8216;Th&#8217;,&#8216;t&#8217; and &#8216;children&#8217; 

              are how we really pronounce &#8216;the&#8217;, &#8216;to&#8217; 

              and &#8216;children&#8217;.<br>

              <br>

              This is a practical help to those children who would otherwise pronounce 

              every bit of a word and end up with something less like its real 

              pronunciation. It has been shown to work well in practice, especially 

              in longer words.<br>

              <br>

              4. There are two regular spellings for the same sound in &#8216;ow&#8217; 

              and &#8216;ou&#8217;, &#8216;aw&#8217; and &#8216;au&#8217;, &#8216;oi&#8217; 

              and &#8216;oy&#8217;. &#8216;Ah&#8217; and &#8216;ar&#8217; are 

              alike in some accents and &#8216;er&#8217;, &#8216;ir&#8217; and 

              &#8216;ur&#8217; are alike in most (except Scottish). Finer differences, 

              not important for decoding meaning, are ignored in MPC. Because 

              the system aims to simplify the initial stages of reading the cue-card 

              shows only one symbol for each of these sounds. This should be learnt 

              first and used to substitute over the others so that they can be 

              learnt incidentally in the course of reading. &#8216;Er; and &#8217;oi&#8217; 

              are definitely more common that &#8216;ir&#8217; and &#8216;oy&#8217;. 

              I decided to use &#8216;ow&#8217; rather than &#8216;ou&#8217; and 

              &#8216;au&#8217; rather than &#8216;aw&#8217; on the cue-card, though 

              since the word <em>house</em> is often used at an early stage some 

              teachers might prefer to use &#8216;ou&#8217; and &#8216;aw&#8217;. 

              This isn&#8217;t really important. What<em> is</em> important is 

              that one or the other should be chosen initially. The teacher can 

              point out the similarity at a very early stage and stop using a 

              substitution. <br>

              <br>

              Substitutions may not be necessary for bright children who can soon 

              learn several possibilities, but those who are slow or young will 

              probably need them. MPC gives such pupils the smallest possible 

              initial learning load so that the rest of the phonic work is encountered 

              in the course of reading and can be learnt incidentally as far as 

              possible. The <font color="#000000"><em>MPC Spelling Workbook</em></font> 

              is designed to reinforce and consolidate these rules. Once they 

              are known, the aid can be discarded. There is not a set scheme for 

              dispensing with certain things at each stage because needs will 

              vary from child to child and class to class. Completely individual 

              discarding of cues would be difficult within a class, but children 

              will neglect them when they no longer need them and so provide their 

              own grading to some extent.</font></p>
