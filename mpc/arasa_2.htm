            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How can 
              you, the teacher, use MPC? There is no set scheme for its use because 
              so many teachers have found its flexibility to be one of MPC&#8217;s 
              great advantages. However, this book is accompanied by the <em><font color="#000000"><a href="resources.htm">MPC 
              Word List</a></font></em>, which contains over 6000 cued words, 
              the <em><font color="#FF0000"><a href="resources.htm">MPC Reading 
              Workbook</a></font></em> and the <em><font color="#FF0000"><a href="resources.htm">MPC 
              Spelling Workbook</a></font></em> (see <a href="arasa_6.htm#A2">Appendix 
              2</a>). As their titles suggest, these are designed for individual 
              use by the pupils to aid and reinforce their learning. These two 
              workbooks and simple dictionary provide a phonic scheme which can 
              be used to extend and accompany other work in reading. The skills 
              learnt from using these books will aid both the sight learning of 
              common words and the attack and spelling of new ones.<br>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In contrast 
              to the limited choice of reading material found in set reading schemes, 
              <em>any</em> passages can be marked with MPC. The boundless range 
              thus offered means that learners can absorb the relationships between 
              spelling and pronunciation, using MPC to aid in the decoding of 
              new words, while reading really interesting material. No formal 
              phonic instruction is necessary once the forty-five sounds and the 
              skill of blending have been learnt. Spelling-pronunciation relationships 
              can then be learnt as are grammatical forms, mainly through unconscious 
              absorption. For example if &#8216;<img src="images/words/bright.png" width="41" height="20" align="absbottom">&#8217;, 
              &#8216;<img src="images/words/sight.png" width="36" height="20" align="absbottom">&#8217;, 
              &#8216;<img src="images/words/light.png" width="31" height="20" align="absbottom">&#8217;,

              are continually encountered when reading, the deduction that &#8216;igh&#8217; 
              is pronounced &#8216;<img src="images/words/i.png" width="9" height="17">&#8217; 
              seems inevitable. At the same time the pupil is taking an interest 
              in what he is reading, other context cues are present and, because 
              there is no hold-up over difficult words, fluency is being developed. 
              Moreover, MPC continually highlights the relationships between sound 
              and spelling.<br>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
              does the pupil usually do when stuck on a word? He can ask, &#8220;What&#8217;s 
              that word?&#8221; and be told. Sometimes, instead of saying the 
              word, the teacher might encourage a guess from the context: &#8220;What 
              could it be? What is she doing?&#8221; or, &#8220;Well, what is 
              that in the picture?&#8221; The pupil might be told to read on and 
              then might also say, &#8220;Try and build it up. Say the sounds.&#8221; 
              Unless the reading book is carefully graded for phonic difficulty, 
              insistence on a thorough attempt at building may easily result in 
              &#8216;t-h-o-r-o-u-g-h&#8217;. This is not much help unless many 
              rules and blends are already known, because the single letter-sounds 
              are not always a good guide.<br>
              <br>
              The wise teacher will probably suggest a guess from context, checked 
              by the main consonant sounds, as a useful compromise. For instance, 
              if a pupil reads &#8216;He wanted a bike&#8217; when the text is 
              &#8216;He roda a bike&#8217;, the &#8216;r&#8217; and &#8216;d&#8217; 
              in &#8216;rode&#8217; could be pointed out and another guess suggested. 
              However, this approach requires good language experience in the 
              pupil and good teaching ability in the teacher, as well as time 
              and individual attention. A pupil soon loses interest if he has 
              to keep stopping, and in many cases will not be able to read at 
              all unless the teacher is hearing him.<br>
              <br>
              The situation will be very different if the pupil knows the sounds 
              and cues of MPC. He will not use the cues for words he knows, but 
              coming to &#8216;<img src="images/words/rode.png" width="32" height="16">&#8217; 
              will be able to say it straight away, without asking anybody, or 
              losing the meaning of the sentence by stopping. It is just as effective 
              as if the teacher was beside him saying, &#8220;You don&#8217;t 
              sound the &#8216;e&#8217; but it makes the &#8216;o&#8217; sound 
              &#8216;<img src="images/words/o.png" width="10" height="14">&#8217;&#8221;, 
              and is certainly quicker. I have heard children using MPC get the 
              word almost immediately without even having to say the sounds aloud.<br>
              <br>
              Experiments show that MPC not only aids fluency and independence, 
              but also, because it leaves the word-shape unaltered (unlike<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet"> 
              i.t.a.</a>), constantly presents the sound-symbol relationship to 
              the child.<br>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, 
              good teachers have all sorts of ways to prevent children getting 
              stuck or discouraged. Some see that all or most of the new words 
              to be met are learnt beforehand through flashcards, games and drill 
              in which interest is provided by the competition or puzzle element. 
              These may be individual or group activities (see Appendix 1). Cues 
              can be used in preliminary work of this kind if books cannot be 
              marked. One way of doing this is to write the same word on both 
              sides of a flashcard and add cues to one side. The cued words can 
              be shown first and their structure pointed out, e.g. &#8216;should&#8217; 
              is made up from &#8216;<img src="images/words/sh.png" width="17" height="16">&#8217;, 
              not &#8216;s-h&#8217;, and &#8216;ould&#8217;, pronounced &#8216;<img src="images/words/ood.png" width="27" height="14">&#8217;. 
              This is easily seen when cued. The structure could be made more 
              obvious by asking the pupils to find smaller words within the word, 
              e.g. in &#8216;become&#8217;. They may already know &#8216;be&#8217; 
              and &#8216;come&#8217;, but if not, the marks will help them to 
              remember how they sound, e.g. &#8216;<img src="images/words/come.png" width="40" height="17">&#8217;. 
              In marking a word like &#8216;become&#8217; it might be more accurate 
              to put &#8216;<img src="images/words/become.png" width="58" height="19">&#8217;, 
              but it is best to use the letters which are already there as far 
              as possible if this gives a sufficient guide, e.g. &#8216;<img src="images/words/become_2.png" width="58" height="17">&#8217;. 
              It must be stressed once again that there is no absolutely right 
              or wrong way of marking any word. The teacher must use MPC as it 
              is most helpful to her pupils, discarding and adapting as necessary. 
              Separating words or syllables with strokes also helps to make the 
              structure more obvious, but would probably prove rather distracting 
              if done on books.<br>
              <br>
              Having gone through a few cued words in this way, the children will 
              enjoy trying to remember them when shown the uncued side of each 
              flashcard. I have found from experience that this really amuses 
              and interests them. Moreover, because they have built up and can 
              reconstruct the words for themselves, the children will remember 
              them far better than if they had simply been told them by the teacher.<br>
              <br>
              Another variation on this idea is to give children the words of 
              a new book written on small cards, again cued on one side and not 
              on the other. I found this most effective with a group of backward 
              seven-year-olds. They put their words in a tin and, after going 
              through them once at school, took them home. The MPC marks are so 
              simple parents learn them very quickly and can then help their children 
              with them. If the sounds are already thoroughly learnt the children 
              can work out what the new words are. They then really enjoy the 
              puzzle of trying to read the uncued words and only looking at the 
              other side if they are stuck. Some children using MPC in this way 
              were overheard saying:&#8221; No, don&#8217;t turn it over yet. 
              I think I can get it.&#8221; I think I know what it is but I&#8217;m 
              not telling yet. I&#8217;ll turn it over first and see if I&#8217;m 
              right (Turns it.) Yes, I&#8217;m right. It&#8217;s --------.&#8221; 
              One child, whom I met in the street during the holidays, said, &#8220; 
              I don&#8217;t half like them words. I do &#8216;em every night.&#8221;<br>
              <br>
              Of course, the way one teaches and the relationship one builds up 
              with pupils will affect the result, but there does seem to be something 
              about using MPC which appeals as a kind of game. The child is motivated 
              not just by wanting to win a competitive game, but also by an individual 
              challenge which stimulates thought. Moreover, MPC is not separate 
              from reading.<br>
              <br>
              Having studied individual words in this way, the child is delighted 
              to find that the next book in the reading scheme can be read fluently. 
              This achievement provides further encouragement.<br>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One experiment 
              was carried out with a middle and top Infants group over the nine 
              months from the autumn half-term till July. Bookmarks, made from 
              thin strips of a card on which new words were written with cues, 
              were duplicated to provide a thorough and systematic progress through 
              a whole reading scheme. Most published readers give lists of new 
              words encountered. The words in these lists were arranged to fit 
              the size of a bookmark, so the first one covered pages 1-10, the 
              second pages 11-24, etc., according to the number of words needed. 
              Large print was used for the letters, so that they could be cued 
              easily and be seen clearly by the children. A set of wall pockets 
              was made to hold the bookmarks in sets, there being three or four 
              bookmarks for each book. When a child finished a bookmark, it was 
              put back in the right pocket and the child could sign his name on 
              a list attached, which acted as a simple and effective means of 
              recording progress. When he had a new book mark the teacher went 
              through it with him, seeing that he could work out the words. There 
              was no difficulty if the sounds were thoroughly known; the child 
              could look up the cued version of a new word on his bookmark instead 
              of having to ask the teacher. However, because normal reading methods 
              were being used alongside MPC, some children were reading books 
              before they had learnt the sounds properly, and so needed help. 
              This is also a good way of using cues without marking books.<br>
              <br>
              From this experiment, I feel that most children under six are better 
              using whole-word learning and making sure of the sounds in various 
              ways so that they can analyse later. Some are still at the intuitive 
              stage and not ready for exact analysis, but are in various stages 
              of pre-reading. They may use MPC in an unanalytical way. For example, 
              when confusing &#8216;<img src="images/words/this%20is.png" width="41" height="17">&#8217; 
              with &#8216;<img src="images/words/here%20is.png" width="49" height="16">&#8217;, 
              as so many do, they may say to themselves &#8220;&#8217;here&#8217; 
              has a cross at the end. I&#8217;ll remember it by that. &#8220;This 
              does no harm, whereas forcing the child to use the cues properly 
              is more likely to confuse than help. Children are bothered by &#8216;funny 
              marks they can&#8217;t understand&#8217;, so professional judgement 
              is needed as to when to start.<br>
              <br>
              My own experience leads me to think that, while the child can start 
              learning individual sounds very young, analysing and synthesising 
              are linked with the ability to perceive the relationships between 
              a whole and its parts. This ability can be assessed using Piaget&#8217;s 
              tests with something like wooden beads of two colours. See what 
              answers a child gives when asked, &#8220;Are all the red beads made 
              of wood? Are all the wooden beads red?&#8221; Or do the experiment 
              with two equal-sized pens. Put them one above the other and say, 
              &#8220;Are they the same length?&#8221; Then move one part to the 
              side and say, &#8220;Are they still the same?&#8221; Children who 
              can only take one side into account, or one factor at a time, are 
              going to be more confused than helped by phonic analysis. Yet knowing 
              letter-sounds, and so with what sounds a word begins or ends, will 
              help their reading by giving them extra clues to the words.<br>
              <br>
              The teacher should thus concentrate on plenty of spoken language, 
              some whole-word and sentence reading, paying attention to pre-reading 
              skills and to learning of sounds and letters representing them. 
              When the sounds are known and understood MPC can be used for rapid 
              progress and independence.<br>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the 
              majority of poor readers of seven or over, sight-learning of whole 
              words is not the answer. They must acquire some skills of word-attack. 
              They are often discouraged and difficult to interest or to persuade 
              to concentrate, and will, of course, have all sorts of problems 
              and reasons for backwardness, which may need investigation. This 
              aspect will not be examined here, as it is thoroughly dealt with 
              in so many other books. It should be stressed that if any teacher 
              is so inexperienced as to think that one method or idea is going 
              to wipe out all problems she will be disappointed, and I would be 
              the last to suggest that MPC or any other idea will do this. However, 
              they may help in some cases and the teacher should therefore be 
              aware of all possible approaches. Of course, much training and skill 
              is still necessary to know what to do and when and how to do it.<br>
              <br>
              MPC&#8217;s advantage for slow or backward Junior or Secondary children 
              is mainly that phonic experience can develop through reading in 
              context, with only the forty-five sounds-symbols to be memorised. 
              Memory, which is so often faulty in these children, can be supplemented 
              by reasoning when MPC is used. The infallibility of the scheme is 
              a great relief to such pupils, and boost their confidence immensely. 
              Years ago, when I was trying to help slow Juniors, I had to keep 
              apologising to them for the irregularities of our spelling. I tried 
              to teach them to think, and then they would say, for example, &#8220; 
              You told us the &#8216;e&#8217; at the end makes a vowel &#8216;say 
              its name&#8217;. Why doesn&#8217;t it in &#8216;gone&#8217; and 
              &#8216;have&#8217;?! All I could say was, &#8220; I&#8217;m sorry, 
              but it doesn&#8217;t always work.&#8221; Some children can remember 
              a certain number of exceptions to rules, but after a certain pint 
              they just give up. An E.S.N school reported to me that the whole 
              atmosphere there had changed since they started using i.t.a. May 
              boys who had given up trying and become disruptive found that they 
              now had a chance to succeed, and changed their attitude completely. 
              For children such as these to have to learn changed spellings later 
              is an unnecessary burden when MPC can have the same regularising 
              benefits without altering normal spelling. A teacher who had just 
              explained MPC marks to a boy who already knew most of the phonic 
              sounds reports that, after trying it, he came running out to her 
              shouting, &#8220;It works&#8221; another teacher remembers a boy 
              in a similar circumstances saying to her, &#8220;Why ever didn&#8217;t 
              you tell me about this before?&#8221;<br>
              <br>
              In <em>The Improvement of Reading</em> (McGraw Hill, 1967) Strang 
              quotes a youth at a clinic, who said, &#8220;There&#8217;s one thing 
              I don&#8217;t like, when you&#8217;re reading out loud and you come 
              to a word and you can&#8217;t pronounce it and the teacher tells 
              me what it is.&#8221; The older and, possibly, the more intelligent 
              the slow reader is, the more he resents his inferiority and lack 
              of independence. Once he has learnt the MPC sounds and symbols and 
              can use them, he can read marked material without reference to the 
              teacher, because he can find out words for himself. This boosts 
              confidence and also means he can work without constant attention 
              and help, which usually results in a lot more being done and experience 
              gained.<br>
              <br>
              Slow readers who have poor sight memory but are not too weak on 
              reasoning or sound discrimination are most likely to be helped by 
              MPC. Once they have learnt the system they can read marked workcards, 
              which will sometimes enable them to do the same work as better readers. 
              It may also be helpful to mark difficult words as they are encountered, 
              either in the book or on a piece of fairly stiff plastic which can 
              be held over the page and marked in felt-tipped pen. This is a good 
              idea if you want to use MPC in books but cannot mark them.<br>
              <br>
              Teachers who <em>can</em> mark books may be unable to do so through 
              lack of time. This problem can be solved by adding cues to any word 
              which children need help when hearing them read. If this is done 
              continually, books will soon have cues marked where necessary without 
              any extra time having been spent doing it.<br>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of 
              the advantages cited by advocates of i.t.a. is that it enables young 
              children to write freely, as they spell entirely by sound. There 
              is not doubt that such free writing is inhibited by the irregular 
              spelling of traditional orthography. One of the greatest problems 
              when teaching writing in t.o. is thus helping children with words. 
              Usually they have to be written by the teacher in individual wordbooks, 
              and it is difficult to avoid a queue waiting for this to be done. 
              It is some help not to have too many children writing at once, but 
              if others are doing maths, need conversation or help with making 
              something, there is still a question of priorities. Teachers try 
              to make children be as independent as possible by encouraging them 
              to try their own version, to look up words on lists or in simple 
              dictionaries, or by writing up words likely to be needed beforehand. 
              Another good idea is to give each child a plain sheet of paper and 
              a paperclip to attach it to his wordbook, and only to help with 
              a word when he has made an attempt on the paper. If the word is 
              right it is quicker just to say so, or there may be only one letter 
              to alter.<br>
              <br>
              A child could also write using MPC sounds on the loose sheet in 
              his wordbook to be altered if necessary by the teacher, or ticked 
              if correct, e.g. &#8216;<img src="images/words/having%20rit%20right.png" width="127" height="19" align="absbottom">&#8217;. 
              If a child can remember and spell words like &#8216;tea&#8217; and 
              &#8216;came&#8217; it is not necessary for him to put a cross over 
              the unsounded letters when writing (though this is a help when reading). 
              I do not think it would be wise to encourage children to write using 
              MPC sounds alone when they did not know the correct spelling. Fluency 
              would certainly be increased, but this would result in &#8216;It 
              was my birthday yesterday and eight friends came to tea&#8217; being 
              written &#8216;<img src="images/words/it%20woz%20mi%20berthda.png" width="351" height="20" align="absbottom">&#8217;, 
              which I would not advocate. If a child had no means of finding the 
              right spelling, MPC would enable him to record the sound accurately, 
              but spelling should be as normally correct as possible from the 
              start, even if it is a bit harder for children to achieve.<br>
              <br>
              In writing, MPC can be used to aid in looking up the correct spelling. 
              Learning the alphabet order is important at this stage, but a child 
              may still look up, for example, &#8216;quiet&#8217; under &#8216;c&#8217; 
              or &#8216;a&#8217;, or not be sure if it is the word he wants because 
              of irregular spelling. The MPC Word List which accompanies this 
              book contains over 600 of the words most commonly used in early 
              spelling together with cues. They are indexed under initial sound 
              as well as initial letter, so that, for example &#8216;phone&#8217; 
              is found under both &#8216;p&#8217; and &#8216;f&#8217;. Spelling 
              and MPC is discussed more fully in Chapter 4.<br>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many 
              teachers prefer not to use a set reading scheme for beginners, but 
              to let them make up their own reading material in some way; <em>Breakthrough 
              to Literacy</em> (Longman) materials may be used, or children&#8217;s 
              pictures with captions and simple sentences written at their dictation 
              and made into books. Wall-story techniques, as explained by Goddard 
              in <em>Reading in the Modern Infants School </em>(ULP, 1958), use 
              a similar idea for group teaching. MPC can be used with any of these 
              approaches.<br>
              <br>
              My own experience here has been mainly with adult illiterates, for 
              whom I found it impossible to provide printed material at a level 
              which did not insult their intelligence, yet which was simple enough 
              to read. They therefore dictated sentences about their jobs, their 
              cars, their families or anything else they liked, which I wrote 
              down on strips of card. They copied these into their books or had 
              them typed on a jumbo typewriter when available. Then they cut up 
              the cards into words, which they used for matching and making other 
              sentences. Some record of words known was needed. One good way to 
              do this was to tick them off in a 500-word book or on a Ladybird 
              <em>Key Words</em> list, adding them if they were not on the list. 
              Then, when the pupils were judged ready, cues were added to the 
              books or words to show the sound-symbol relationship.<br>
              <br>
              In some cases, cues were quickly understood and could then be widely 
              used. In others, much work of an intuitive nature without analysis 
              was needed. The older the pupils, the more diverse their problems 
              and needs. Some, whose reasoning is very poor, need much preliminary 
              work before word attack is possible. Yet I taught one man who was 
              quite intelligent, with a reading age of about seven and no idea 
              of the sounds. He raced ahead using MPC, which he understood at 
              once.<br>

            <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The range 
              of ideas suggested here will have given some idea of the great scope 
              and flexibility of MPC. To try it, there is no need to invest in 
              any new or expensive materials. It can be used in full or in part 
              as needed. It could be used for only some children in a class, without 
              disruption. If a child started it and then changed to a school or 
              class where it was not used, the child might miss it, but would 
              not be at a disadvantage. It makes spelling better, not worse. There 
              is no need for a sudden changeover from using it, just a gradual 
              disuse. By the time a reading age of a about eight is attained MPC 
              should not be needed, except for some spelling practice and analysis 
              of spelling rules (<a href="arasa_4.htm#4">see Chapter 4</a>). It 
              allows phonic practice using reading matter which is not graded 
              for phonic simplicity and which can therefore be in completely natural 
              language. However, it should be remembered that children can cope 
              much better with two-syllable words than with words of three syllables 
              or more. Vocabulary should be largely within the child&#8217;s spoken 
              vocabulary; words may be pronounced but not understood when they 
              are easy to read.<br>
              <br>
              MPC is most readily used to aid reading independence when there 
              is some mental maturity and ability to analyse. It would thus be 
              ideal for reasonably intelligent adults who speak, but cannot read 
              English, as in some of the developing countries. For such pupils 
              cued books would be very useful, enabling independent reading to 
              take place quickly. <a href="arasa_5.htm#5">Chapter 5</a> deals 
              more fully with the use of MPC in various situations and with different 
              age-groups.<br>
              <br>
              It must be emphasised that MPC cannot be used effectively until 
              the sounds have been properly learnt. After that, rapid progress 
              is possible. Preliminary attention to learning the sounds and cues 
              is therefore vital, and is dealt with in the next chapter.</font></p>
