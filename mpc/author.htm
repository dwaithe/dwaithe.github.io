            <blockquote> 
            <p class="MPCtext">&#8221;Sometime 
              ago, when I was an Education Lecturer in a Teachers Training College, 
              it was part of my job to specialise in the teaching of reading and 
              to supervise students who were choosing it for their third year 
              special study. As I was doing a part-time higher degree myself, 
              I decided to do my research in the same subject, and as I had taught 
              at one time using the Initial Teaching Alphabet, I thought I would 
              try to devise something which would overcome the difficulties of 
              our irregular phonic system without changing normal spelling. I 
              investigated various uses of diacritical marks and other methods 
              and what is now described as Minimal Phonic Cues or MPC was the 
              result. After a number of smaller experiments, I managed to get 
              my system tried with two parallel classes in a Primary School, one 
              using MPC and the other as control. The results were good and my 
              University supervisor said that I should try and get published. 
              Before it was accepted, I was asked to produce a Teachers Book and 
              three workbooks, but even the publicity leaflets they produced are 
              enough to explain how it should be used. It was well reproduced 
              and sold well, but is now out of print and I only have a few copies. 
              At the time, systematic teaching was not very fashionable, but the 
              authorities being now concerned with the amount of illiteracy and 
              stressing the need for phonic analysis, my idea may be well received. 
              My main motivation now is to make it available so that adults and 
              children with poor sight memory, who I know from experience need 
              to build up words, will be able to learn more easily using a method 
              free from the irregularities of our English spelling without altering 
              it. As one boy said when introduced to Minimal Phonic Cues. Cool 
              this really works! Why didn&#8217;t you show me it before? My hope 
              is that, when it is on the internet, it will be available to anyone 
              who needs it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
