            <p class="MPCtext">Below 
              is the web version of the MPC Teacher's Book, an invaluable guide for anyone using the MPC system. 
              It covers all the basic principles of the system, as well as giving 
              helpful notes and advice about how to use MPC in particular circumstances, 
              with students of varying ages and abilities. The Teacher's Book 
              also explains fully how to make the best use of the Workbooks and 
              Word List included in this scheme. Please navigate the book by using 
              the dynamic contents located in the right pane. A pdf version of 
              the book can be downloaded from the resources section or by <a href="resources/arasa.PDF">following 
              this link.</a></p>

            <p class="MPCtext">Teachers 

              are constantly looking for ways of helping their pupils, particularly 

              to increase their independence and skill in aiding their own learning 

              and in being able to read alone. A great deal of personal contact 

              with the teacher is required before a child can read instructions 

              and produce written answers. Should this be given by addressing 

              the whole class and directing them all in the same piece of work? 

              Should the children be grouped, with only one section at a time 

              enjoying the teacher&#8217;s whole attention, or should this contact 

              be as far a possible on an individual basis? Whatever means are 

              used, a great deal more learning takes place when children can work 

              on their own and are motivated to do so.</p>

            <p class="MPCtext">As a 

              teacher of infants, I constantly exercised all my ingenuity to provide 

              self-checking activities for the &#8216;other group&#8217; while 

              teaching something new to some of the children. As a teacher of 

              mixed ability Junior classes and rural classes with a wide age-range, 

              I was most worried by the slower children as it was difficult to 

              keep them well occupied in useful learning while others received 

              my main attention.</p>

            <p class="MPCtext">In training 

              students to teach infants, I am frequently asked how to &#8216;give 

              children words&#8217; for writing without long queues forming or 

              children wasting time. Another common problem is how to hear each 

              child read frequently while dealing with all the other activities 

              of the classroom. Bright children with good home support frequently 

              work well on their own because they have early success and are encouraged 

              by it. Lack of success puts children off and they lose interest 

              in the task for its own sake. </p>

            <p class="MPCtext">English 

              spelling is known to be a source of difficulty in learning to read. 

              For a start, there are about forty-four main sounds in the language, 

              but only twenty-six letters in the alphabet. Berkiansky (1969) worked 

              with a group studying phonics. They identified sixty-nine letters 

              representing single sounds and seventy-nine different ways of spelling 

              the six vowels &#8216;a&#8217;, &#8216;e&#8217;, &#8216;i&#8217;, 

              &#8216;o&#8217;, &#8216;u&#8217; and &#8216;y&#8217;. More than 

              one in ten common words were exceptions to any rule and 166 rules 

              had to be devised to cover the remaining 5431 words in their sample 

              taken from early reading books. No wonder some teachers have thought 

              that whole-word learning was better than attempting phonics! Yet 

              some ability to attack words not learnt as wholes is absolutely 

              necessary, or we are faced with the even more formidable task of 

              memorising thousands of whole words before we can read very much.</p>

            <p class="MPCtext">Minimal 

              phonic cues (MPC) solves this initial, basic problem by providing 

              a simple and easily-learnt method of word attack. This book presents 

              a variety of ideas for using MPC, which aims to lighten the task 

              of learning to read by giving early success and independence, two 

              conditions vital to further progress.</p>

            <p class="MPCtext"><strong>NB</strong> Throughout 

              this book the teacher is referred to as &#8216;she&#8217; and the 

              pupil as &#8216;he&#8217;. This purely for convenience. Everything 

              said is of course addressed to teachers of both sexes and refers 

              to both girls and boys.</p>
